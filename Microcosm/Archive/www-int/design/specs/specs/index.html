<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>World Specification Documents</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>by Christina Allen</H2>
Hello (again),<P>

We are starting to design and build worlds for ourselves and others.<P>

Our first *big* external partner (Turner) has divided their contract into
separate design (small $$) and implementation phases (bigger $$).  The
design phase should begin this week and will end on 6 September. Based on
what they receive on 6 September, Turner will decide whether to use us for
the implementation phase.<P>

So, what do they get on 6 September?<P>

The Turner contract raises some interesting issues about actual deliverables
and our world development process by potentially distributing design,
technology and implementation tasks across different organizations. <P>

We need to design a World Design Specification type that will serve a whole
bunch of audiences and purposes, for Turner, Microcosm and beyond...<P>

<UL>
<LI>AUDIENCES:
<UL>
<LI>Customers (e.g., Turner finance, marketing, product design, merchandising)
<LI>Prime contractors for World Development (e.g., ATT or SRI)
<LI>Network Providers
<LI>Implementors
<LI>All EC factions
<LI>Artists and animators
<LI>etc.
</UL>
<LI>PURPOSES:
<UL><LI>Business--e.g., Turner uses this internally to justify implementation phase
<LI>Technical--coordinating internal and external development
<LI>Methodological--provides basis for scheduling and team coordination
<LI>Experience and UI Design--link designs to social and technical expectations
<LI>etc.
</UL>
<LI>What does a World Design Specification look like?
<LI>What will be our internal process for developing one?
</UL>
Attached is an outline based on conversations with Randy about what he has
done in past situations.  <P>

Please take a look at it and mark it up based how you think it ought to be
organized, expanded, contracted, changed.  Let me know what parts you need
to do your piece of World Development or negotiation.  Think about the
external organizations most closely related to your piece and what they
would need to have.  Then send it back.  We'll go through a few rounds...<P>

<H1>World Design Specification Outline</H1>

<OL>
<H2><LI>USER EXPERIENCE DOCUMENT</H2>
"What does the world do?"<P>
Offers a story about a fictional character moving through the World.<BR>
Different fonts are used to describe (1) the user,s experiences and actions,
(2) associated system behaviors and (3) designer comments and questions to
readers. This section is revised throughout the pre-launch and post-launch
development cycles. <P>

<H2><LI>SCREEN MOCK-UPS</H2>
Includes screen mock-ups detailing both art and interface requirements
related to the locations defined in the USER EXPERIENCE DOCUMENT. <P>

<H2><LI>UNUM LIST AND DESIGN SPECIFICATION</H2>
Specifies each unum,s name and behaviors (how it interacts with other unums).<P>

<H2><LI>ART TASK LIST</H2>
Lists the necessary artwork.<P>

<H2><LI>SOUND TASK LIST</H2>
Lists the sounds associated  with art and the unums.  Sounds can merely be
decorative or  can signal unum behavior to players.  Sounds are reusable
resources. <P>

<H2><LI>WORLD LAYOUT AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN</H2>
Describes how to stitch the individual unums together into complex locations.<P>
 
* Relies on the World ontology developed in the design of Unums.  Offices
could be made up "ceilings," "floors" and "doors."  Or, of "wood," "plastic"
and "metal."  It depends on what makes sense for the whole world design. <P>

<H2><LI>USER INTERFACE DOCUMENT</H2>
Describes the requirements of the User Interface.  Aimed at programmers.  UI
design comes from many cycles of revision on the USER EXPERIENCE section. <P>

<H2><LI>WORLD GUIDELINES</H2>
These are instructions for extending the world beyond its original design.
It incorporates feedback from World Builders as they start putting the World
together. <P>

<H2><LI>TERMS OF SERVICE</H2>
Describes Terms of  Service between the customers and the service provider.
Details the border conditions that users can expect in the World and in
different regions of the World.  Describes whether the World inherits any
Terms of  Service from Internet providers or other related entities. <P>

<H2><LI>SECURITY DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES</H2>
Describes technical security issues and commitments and relationships
(regarding computers, networks, services and providers).<P>

<H2><LI>SUPPORT AND OPERATIONS PLAN</H2>
Describes plans for support (users, developers, administrators) and
operations (network, facility, hardware).<P>

<H2><LI>LICENSE LIST</H2>
Describes the additional functionality that the world will require and that
are best offered by other vendors.  Includes functional specifications,
recommendations of vendors and pricing estimates. <P>

One huge problem we've had is <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/archives/ec_perf/0679.html">class
bloat</A>.&nbsp; One thought that <A HREF="mailto:walendo@communities.com">Walendo
</A>and I (<A HREF="mailto:slewis@communities.com">Scott</A>) came up with
during a discussion this morning is the following:&nbsp; The java handling
of class garbage collection is changing (for the good IMHO).&nbsp; Formerly,
the rules for unloading classes were confusing, and caused some problems
for our code (i.e. classes were unloaded by the gc, when we needed for
them to stay around).&nbsp; The new rules for the garbage collector are
basically as follows: </P>

<P>Classes are gc'ed only if their classloader is gc'ed.&nbsp; Classes
loaded by the null classloader are never gc'ed. </P>

<P>One opportunity for memory saving that this affords:&nbsp; for classes
that we know are used only once (e.g. startup code), we might want to create
a special classloader instance to load those classes (it could just trivially
turn around and call getSystemClass [or whatever it's called]).&nbsp; Then
when the code is finished with these classes this trivial classloader could
turn around and be released, and the loaded classes would then be gc'ed.&nbsp;
This could be done for any code that we know is used only once, or even
code that is only used rarely (the repeated load time might be worth paying
in this case to save on memory usage). </P>

<P>[Bill 29 May 1998] Looking at Russ's <A HREF="JavaObjectCount.html">table
of memory usage</A>, I see a an increase between the 4 transition and 31
transition measurement of 1201 hashtables but only 2614 hash table entries.
If these hashtables were allocated with a small initial number of entries,
we could save on the order of 400K. We could save even more if they are
garbage and can be dropped.</P>

<h2>The Neocosm Worry List</h2>

<p>Updated by anyone who has a worry worth worrying about. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><br>
Format of this list: </p>

<ol>
    <li>[Author Date] Worry</li>
</ol>

<p>These are issues that as far as the submitter knows are not
being planned for or looked at.&nbsp; For a worry to go off this
list, it either needs to be empirically shown not to be a worry,
or it needs to have a good enough plan for dealing with it that
it's no longer considered worrisome--in the opinion of the person
who owns the worry!&nbsp; Some things, like performance, are only
no longer worries when we have a working well-performing system;
other things, like architectural issues, are only worries until
we have a resolution that has been reviewed and that's considered
livable. <br>

    <li><h3>Architectural/subsystem gating decisions</h3>
    </li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] The microvats question:&nbsp; do we
        continue the current one-vat-per-process concurrency
        policy, or do we go to a more microvat-like concurrency
        model where each object has its own run queue
        machinery?&nbsp; The former is more like the current
        alpha's architecture; the latter has different and
        perhaps more robust concurrency behavior.&nbsp; This
        decision has a peculiar latch: if we assume one run queue
        per process, we will rapidly start writing code that will
        break in a run-queue-per-object model; but if we make the
        latter assumption (a run queue per object), that code
        will run fine if there is only one run queue per process.</li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] More generally, a simple and adequate
        DObjects framework that everyone believes in is a very
        high priority.</li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] The GUI framework: what new UI framework
        will we use for our GUI?</li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] The renderer: what do we do?</li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] The repository: who will own it?</li>
    <li>[Tony 19 May 98] The repository: How about alternatives?
        We could use a hard definition of the requirements for
        this piece. JAR files have been mentioned as a
        possibility. Standard file support would be good
        (especially for production).</li>
    <li>[Tony 19 May 98] The repository: Art download. This was
        never fully working. Do we have any documentation on
        what's needed or missing?</li>
    <li>[Bill 20 May 98] Where should we draw the line between
        what is implemented in Java and what is in C/C++?</li>
    <li>[Tony 20 May 98] Localization. Our current menus.uifile
        approach is doing double duty as a UI layout file and a
        localization solution. We need to break these apart. In
        particular, the current menus.uifile approach makes
        creating swatchable items difficult, because the
        artist/designer must edit this file to add new swatch
        labels.</li>
    <li>[Tony 20 May 98] Event model. Even if we don't ship a
        full-fledged scripting language right away, having an
        event model could be very valuable. We could get a bunch
        of behavior just by letting objects respond to a small
        number of pre-defined events (enterRegion, avatarSpeech,
        pickUp, putDown, etc...) </li>
    <li>[Tony 22 May 98] Extensibility. There is a very wide
        spectrum of possible work here. It's very likely that any
        solutions will require some thought up front in our
        desgin decisions. See <a href="Extensibility.html">Extensibility</a>
        for a discussion of different ways in which we could
        allow users to extend the world..</li>
    <li>[Tony 27 May 98] Upgradable Production. We have a
        reasonable story for packaging new resources into a
        separate repository. What we've never really addressed,
        and what I imagine *all* customers will want is the
        ability to add new regions to a running process. Imagine,
        for instance, if we wanted to add 5 new regions to
        BeachTown and connect them to the Lighthouse. We can't do
        this now. This isn't an unsolvable problem, but we'll
        need to provide support for this sort of thing.</li>
    <li>[Jeff 02 June 98] Naming.. We've talked about the name
        problem.&nbsp; Its really cool that we can have multiple
        avatars with the same name.&nbsp; However, teleport pad
        sturdy refs are a bit awkward.&nbsp; It seems that we
        need some sort of naming mechanism. LDAP might be a good
        mechanism for naming.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>[Jeff 02 June 98] User-friendly sturdy refs: Something
        like ec://directory.communities.com/turfs/MyTurfName
        would be nice. (Though I fear it would be problematic.)<br>
        </li>
    <li>[Tony 04 June 98] Hub management. We never really nailed down
        a story for how hub operators could do reasonable server management
        of a running hub. Specifically: how can I take a running realm that's
        now getting heavy traffic and split its regions over two servers? 
        Also, can I move a running realm from one server to another?<br>
        </li>
    <li>[Tony 09 June 98] Compile to native code. One of the benefits of moving to
    	pure Java is that we get to use all the slick new IDEs and tools coming out.
    	One of the biggest potential wins in this arena is the ability to compile our
    	app to native code. If it turns out that this is a big win, we might want to consider
    	enforcing that we're always able to do this-- checking in code that breaks native
    	compilation would be considered a real build break. It seems wise to get on this wagon
    	sooner rather than later.<br>
        </li>


    <li><h3>Implementation issues</h3>
    </li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] Will the new system perform well in 32
        megs?&nbsp; This is something we have to stay on top of
        continuously, and is mentioned here only to keep it from
        falling off our radar screens.</li>
    <li>[Tony 19 May 98] Performance metrics. Remember January?
        We should have targets in mind for things like startup,
        region transitions, etc. And we should have (ideally
        automated) testing of these so that we never lose sight
        of the actual product and its requirements.</li>
    <li>[Bob 27 May 98] Is there a dichotomy between
        'serialization to comm' and 'serialization everywhere
        else'? If we can make this statement, then implementing
        proxies as a simple extension (using inherited traits,
        perhaps) to the underlying object serialization becomes
        much simpler. Proxied objects will be the only ones that
        need to have any special code, and all of the special
        case checking could be done in the superclass -- freeing
        the programmer from having to worry explicitly about comm
        serialization -- merely marking an object as 'proxyable'
        by inheritance would be sufficient.</li>
    <li><h3>Personnel issues</h3>
    </li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] Where is the engineering VP???&nbsp;
        Every passing day costs us....</li>
    <li>[RobJ 18 May 98] We need a better concept of what QA
        should do in this organization.&nbsp; We won't have a QA
        manager anytime very soon but we need to start doing
        design for testability and generally getting engineering
        agreement on what QA's role could most effectively be.</li>

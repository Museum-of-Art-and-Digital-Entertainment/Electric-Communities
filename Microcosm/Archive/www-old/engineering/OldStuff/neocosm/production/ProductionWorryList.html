<H1>Production Worry List</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>These are things we can't let slip. </P>

<H2>Worries</H2>

<H3>Scope of tools</H3>

<P>[Tony, 19 May 1998] There is a lot of work to be done on the Production
tools. The task list generated in February showed about 12 engineer-month's
worth of work. </P>

<H3>Tool definition</H3>

<P>[Tony, 19 May 1998] The tools are constantly looking for input. There
are so many different ways we could take them-- an enormous range in the
amount of work we could choose to do. We need to know who the customers
are and exactly what they want from the media tools. </P>

<H3>Behavioral editing</H3>

<P>[Tony, 19 May 1998] Do we want to do any kind of scripting language.
This would be even more work. Hard to overestimate this piece. </P>

<H3>3D dynamo and parser</H3>

<P>[Tony, 19 May 1998] They should be re-written. They're both messy. The
animation engine works now, but the state of the code suggests difficult
maintenance. The parser is totally sub-standard-- it only implements a
fraction of the VRML spec. </P>

<H3>AnyChannel renderer</H3>

<P>[Tony, 19 May 1998] This has proven to be one of the more stable pieces
of Microcosm. I want to make sure we don't underemphasize how valuable
it has been having russ on site. We should definitely re-establish our
contacts with AnyChannel sooner rather than later so that we can have bugs
addressed as smoothly as possible. It's probably worth pointing out to
them how lucky they've been that we haven't bothered them in a year and
that their tech support was handled by Russ. We deserve good support from
them since they've gotten such a break so far. </P>

<H3>Which UI components</H3>

<P>[Tony, 19 May 1998] The tools work could use either JFC or WFC. There's
certainly some gain to be had by sticking with whatever we use from Cosm.
If J++ and WFC turn out to be significantly easier to do lots of frame
layout in, then I'd seriously consider a separate tools project that could
use J++ to build just the tools. </P>

<H3>GIF support</H3>

<P>[Tony, 19 May 1998] We need to get a license squared away if we're going
to provide GIF support. </P>

<H3>Extensibility</H3>

<P>[Tony 22 May 1998] There is a very wide spectrum of possible work here.
It's very likely that any solutions will require some thought up front
in our desgin decisions. See <A HREF="..\Extensibility.html">Extensibility</A>
for a discussion of different ways in which we could allow users to extend
the world..</P>

<P>[Bill 28 May 1998] Our current property sheet allows an object to be
adjusted in the x, y, and z directions, and to be rotated around the yaw
axis. One in-world encounter I had indicated that someone wanted to lay
an object flat on the floor. Doing that would require rotating the object
around the pitch or roll axis. Do we need full 6 way in-world control over
3D objects?</P>

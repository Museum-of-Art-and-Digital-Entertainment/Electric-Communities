<H2>Introduction</H2>
Known constraints of our renderer/dynamics engine that impact art and design.


<H3>Swatching yields 24-bit textures</H3>
All of the 8-bit textures involved get promoted to 24-bit. This triples the 
memory cost of textures for swatchable objects.
<P>
It may be possible to do have the swatching output be 8-bit, but it would be slow:
<P>
To do the swatching, there would at least have to be a temporary 24 bit buffer in 
which we mix the swatch and intensity map values. This has to be in 24-bit color 
space since there's no way of knowing what color range you'll need up front, and 
thus no way mixing into a 256 color palette.
<P>
Once the mixing operation is done, it's possible to then convert back to an 8-bit
image and throw away the 24-bit buffer. This would dramataically reduce our memory 
usage for swatching. The problem is the conversion. Creating an optimal palette for 
the image and then converting to an 8-bit image that uses that palette is *expensive*.
For a very rough estimate... I took a quarter size screenshot of Habitats and did the 
quick 8-bit conversion in PaintShopPro... roughly a second. I'm Sure there's room for 
improvement, but it's slow.

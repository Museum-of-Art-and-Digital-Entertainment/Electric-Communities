<H2>Introduction</H2>

Production tools cover a fairly broad category of utilities and tools used 
for getting all kinds of media into the system. The current set of tools uses
a mixture of Visual Basic and C. In February, 1998, we had laid out a roadmap for
porting the existing tools to Java and adding new functionality.

<H2>Requirements</H2>

The production tools must be able to import a variety of media, allow the user
to manipulate and annotate the media, and then save it in a format recognizable
by the ECHabitats software. Specifically the tools must allow import of:
<LI>2D bitmaps</LI>
<LI>3D geometry, with textures and animation data</LI>

<P>The tools must be able to produce output compatible with ECHabitats. 
Today, that means:
<LI>Appearance2D Files</LI>
<LI>Appearance3D Files</LI>
<LI>RealmText Files</LI>
<LI>Catalog Files</LI>

<P>

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<H4>Current Architecture Overview</H4>

The current tools are essentially import only. They allow the user to import
art-- 2D or 3D-- and they output working Appearance files and/or RealmText
files for the object(s) being imported.
<P>There are 3 main import tools:<BR>

<LI><B>SceneEater2D.</B> Allows the user to import layered Photoshop files in which
each layer of the image is a separate object in the region. Outputs separate
BMP and Appearance files for each object and a RealmText file that contains
all of them.</LI>

<LI><B>SceneEater3D.</B> Allows the user to import a VRML region. Saves separate
VRML and Appearance files for each object and a RealmText file that contains
all of them.</LI>

<LI><B>Import3D.</B> Allows the user to import single 3D objects, including avatars.</LI>

<H4>Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>

Please see the <A HREF="TaskList.html">Task List and Schedule For Production Tools</A> 
for a detailed list of the proposed tools and estimates at a schedule.
<P>
<P>Here's a summary of

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
<B>Reading/Writing Image Formats.</B> We've already purchased a toolkit for dealing with image file formats. This will allow us 
to use any image format we'd want to. The toolkit is very complete and includes support for
BMP, PNG, GIF, JPG and many others. <B><I>We need to get a license squared away if we're
going to have GIF support in our software.</I></B> Arnold was looking into this at one point. I believe
I still have the contact information. Randy and I have talked about GIF support in general. 
We could probably get away with using Java's GIF support for standalone images and then 
convert them internally to some other format-- PNG, e.g. One thing that the toolkit 
provides, and that Randy, for one, really wants, is Animated GIF support.

<P><B>Macromedia FLASH.</B> Doug had mentioned Macromedia's FLASH technology as an excellent format for 
lightweight, programmable graphics. The good news is that Macromedia has made public
the specs for the file format. The downside, as far as I can tell, is that we'd need
to write our own Flash renderer to use it-- or license on from Macromedia. I didn't see
a licensable renderer last time I looked. Most of their focus seems to be on 
web browser support.

<P><B>VRML.</B> We currently have a crappy VRML parser. It supports just a minimum set 
of compliant VRML. I've seen two possibilities for improving this. Cosmo Software
(SGI's VRML division) has a public domain parser available: 
<A HREF="http://www.cosmosoftware.com/developer/">http://www.cosmosoftware.com/developer/</A>. 
Look for the "Parsers and Code section. 
<P>I also found another company, 3dWeb, that sells a VRML parser. 
<A HREF="http://www.3dweb.com/html/products.html">http://www.3dweb.com/html/products.html</A>
The advantage of their product is that it actually builds a scene graph, which would make it 
much easier to integrate with any internal format we have.

<P><B>3DS MAX Plugin</B>Another idea that has been tossed around is to write a plugin for MAX that would either
save directly into our own format, or save to VRML, while fixing a couple of known bugs in the current
MAX VRML export plugin. This is probably more trouble than its worth, and it would tie us to MAX. Providing
better, more general VRML support is still our best bet for 3D geometry input.

<P><B>Java 2D and Java3D.</B> I haven't looked at these enough to see if they'd help us in any way.

<P><B>[XXX Others???]</B>

<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
<I>Lists any special objectives and assumptions of the code e.g. reusability,
thread safety, security, performance, use of resources, compatibility with
existing code etc. This section gives important context for reviewers</I>

<H2>Current implementation</H2>

Here's the flow from the working tools.

<H3>Import3D</H3>
Again, this tool is for importing single 3D objects/avatars.
<P>

<LI>
Read in VRML file. This calls down to Kirk's code, which parses the VRML and creates an AgMesh object.</LI>



<H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
The early work that John and I had started on the Java tools is at:<BR>
\src\cosm1\tools\appearance

<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>
Yes, it is. (Thanks John!) Although admittedly, there's not too much here yet.

<H4>Examples</H4>

<H4>Testing and Debugging</H4>
Our VRML parser is not very good at reporting error messages. It would be great if
we had an easier way to validate VRML files. The proposed VRML parsers above would
probably improve this significantly.

<H2>Design Issues</H2>

<H4>Resolved Issues</H4>
<LI>Appearance file discussion. Why they're separate.</LI>
<LI>Why they can still be misleading.</LI>
<LI>Getting data in the right place. Some belongs in appearance. If it's not static,
it belongs in the unum.</LI>

<H4>Open Issues</H4>
This section is copied from the top of the Task List. It was a running list of items
that needed to be discussed.


<H5>Discuss modular approach to Appearance editors.</H5>
Talk about how each editor could either be a part of a big tool or a separate module
of a group of tools. Talk about why modular is better.

<H5>Discuss unums as files in tool land</H5>
If we want to keep using the text files at all, it makes sense to have a .unum
file which contains essentially the text inside of a CreateUnum block in a RealmText
file. Objects should be able to exist and be edited outside of the context of a RealmText
or a Catalog file.

<H5>Discuss when to port the vb tools</H5>
Sooner vs. later. Keep using the ones that work. Design and implement first the tools that
offer us new functionality. This might change if we do any kind of major architectural
overhaul.

 
<H5>Discuss Interconnectivity of modules</H5>
XXX
 
<H5>Discuss State dictionaries with Arturo</H5>
Evaluate the State dictionaries that Gordie started against RealmText. Would they
provide a better alternative to RealmText. Should we be using standard Java Serialization
instead, where possible?

<H5>Discuss Gesture class and file format for sharing anims among avatars</H5>
XXX

<H5>Discuss tool classes: app2d, app3d, unum, region, realm, catalog</H5>

<H5>Discuss visual editing (3D objects, all regions)</H5>
Do we want to have 3D rendering support in the tools. It would be nice to a least
have the ability to preview, even if we don't offer significant editing features. 
I'm a little nervous about going overboard here. We could spend a lot of time fiddling
with a 3D interface.

<H5>Discuss repository/curation</H5>
Tightly integrate and write directly to repositories or write out .cur files 
and shell out to run the curator?

<H5>Discuss Certificate support</H5>
This is impacted by who's using the tool. One can imagine a button in the tool that says
"Certify this now" and allows for the creation of new certificate types. One can also imagine
a button more for end users that says "Submit this for certification." Mike and I have
had some prreliminary discussions about this-- enough to realize that this is a non-trivial
chunk of work that hasn't been worked all the way through.

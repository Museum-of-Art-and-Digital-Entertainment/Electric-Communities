<h1>Hub Worry List</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [02 June 98,<a
href="mailto:jeff@communities.com"> Jeff</a>]</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>These are issues related to the &quot;HUB&quot; version of the
product that we need to consider moving forward.</p>

<p>The following are based on the assumption that we'll be
carrying forward some (all?) of the &quot;hub&quot; related
features.&nbsp; I'm open to rethinking any of this..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Worries</h2>

<h4>Database access from within cosm</h4>

<p>[Jeff 02 June 98] Hub db access:&nbsp; The database access on
the hub side is very specific to the concept of the &quot;member
db&quot;, and the avatar registration process.&nbsp; It needs to
be more general so we can (if we want) have databases other than
the member db (eg, turf database)</p>

<h4>Avatar registration</h4>

<p>[Jeff 02 June 98] I'm not overly thrilled with the
&quot;avatar registration&quot; concept; it serves the purpose of
limiting access to a world based on login/password.&nbsp; In
addition it provides the &quot;avatar directory&quot;
mechanism.&nbsp; These two things should be uncoupled.</p>

<h4>Directory Server</h4>

<p>[Jeff 02 June 98] General directory server - We currently have
a &quot;hub avatar directory&quot;. We've also planned for
&quot;turf directories&quot; and a &quot;global avatar
directory&quot;.&nbsp; I'm not thrilled with the current
_implementation_ of avatar and turf directories.&nbsp; I'd rather
we develop a more general &quot;directory&quot; mechanism (maybe
a lightweight server app), which can maintain data in an opaque
and extensible manner. Presentation would still be on the
web.&nbsp; In addition to what we have now, this directory
mechanism needs to be able to detect and remove garbage
entries.&nbsp; Finally, its possible that this is a
&quot;generalized&quot; object directory server... that is, it
doesn't have to just hold entries for avatars. If so, then there
probably needs to be a generalized mechanism for getting an
object registered in the directory, etc. This sounds as though
there is some overlap with the PLS, but I think it is distinctly
different.</p>

<h4>Hub control panel for administrators</h4>

<p>[Jeff 02 June 98] Lightweigh hub control panel.&nbsp; We're
doing some things with console mode on the hub and its a bit
rickity.&nbsp; A while back I strawman-spec'ed a hub control
panel but in the crunch we didnt implement it.&nbsp; Features
like finding out how many users are on-line, start/stop, etc.,
would be useful.&nbsp; Yes, you can do some of this from a
habicosm, but its rather heavyweight when all you want to do is
find out who's on before you restart.&nbsp; Also a
&quot;broadcast to all in realm&quot; would be useful.</p>

<h4>BBS - Asynchronous user-user messaging</h4>

<p>[Jeff 02 June 98] We're currently using webboard for
asynchronous communication.&nbsp; The problem with this is it has
a seperate user db.&nbsp; webboard3.0 might help us out (it uses
SqlServer) but its more expensive.&nbsp; First we need to sort
out what, if any, are our asynch communication
requirements.&nbsp; Then we can look at alternatives. </p>

<h4>Web-related content server</h4>

<p>[Jeff 02 June 98] I'm assuming that we'll always have some
components that are &quot;web-based&quot;.&nbsp; Eg, the avatar
directory, the BBS, possibly repositories, etc. We're currently
somewhat tied to IIS (MS web server).&nbsp; Do we want to
consider supporting other web servers?&nbsp; Again we need to
first define what the requirements are... however, knowing this
sooner than later would be a big plus. </p>

<P>
This document describes ECDAF API for application startup and
initial access to core system services. <BR>

<P>
<H2>Basic Startup API</H2>
<P>
The basic API for application startup is very simple. However
it is highly configurable and it is in this configurability where
most of the details reside.
<P>
An ECDAF application must provide a startup class which implements
the interface <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.boot.ELaunchable</FONT>.
This interface consists of a single method:
<PRE>
    public interface ELaunchable {
        void go(EEnvironment env);
    }
</PRE>
<P>
In addition to implementing <FONT FACE="Courier">ELaunchable</FONT>,
the startup class must have a public, zero-argument constructor,
so that the boot code can create an instance of it by invoking
the <FONT FACE="Courier">newInstance()</FONT> method on the startup
class's <FONT FACE="Courier">Class</FONT> object.
<P>
The application is started with a command line of the form:
<PRE>
    java ec.boot.Boot <I>startclass args... </I>
</PRE>
<P>
where <I><FONT FACE="Courier">startclass</FONT></I> is the fully
qualified path name of your application startup class, and <I><FONT FACE="Courier">args...</FONT></I>
are any command line arguments that you wish to pass to the application
itself.
<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">Boot</FONT> class parses the command
line, initializes the core system services, constructs the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>,
creates an instance of your startup class, and then actually starts
the application by sending the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>
to the startup object in a <FONT FACE="Courier">go()</FONT> message.
From the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT> object your
application can then obtain the command line arguments, the properties,
and the root capabilities for all the core system services (see
<B>Core System Services</B> below).
<P>
For example, you might create an application:
<PRE>
    package com.fudco.cool;

    public class CoolApp implements ELaunchable {
        public void go(EEnvironment env) {
            <I>your stuff here...
</I>        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>
and then you might start it with a command line something like:
<PRE>
    java ec.boot.Boot com.fudco.cool.CoolApp <I>args...
</I>
</PRE>

<P>
<H2>Properties and Command Line Arguments</H2>
<P>
The application can obtain the command line arguments from the
<FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>. Before being given to
the application, however, the command line will first be parsed
for arguments which modify the property settings and any such
arguments will be removed from the arguments made available to
the application. The property settings are also available from
the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>, but are indexed
by keyword rather than by position on the command line.
<P>
Property settings may come from property files or from the command
line directly. A properties file is simply a file with a series
of lines of the form:
<PRE>
    <I>name</I>=<I>value</I>
</PRE>

<P>
which is interpreted as setting the value of the property specified
by the keyword <I><FONT FACE="Courier">name</FONT></I> to the
string <I><FONT FACE="Courier">value</FONT></I>.
<P>
Prior to processing the command line itself, a set of default
properties files are read. Currently, ECDAF tries to read three
default properties files: &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">/usr/local/lib/eprops/systemdefault</FONT>&quot;,
&quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">.eprops/default</FONT>&quot; (in the
user's home directory), and &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">/eprops.txt</FONT>&quot;,
in that order. If any or all of these files are missing, the absence
is silently ignored. Furthermore, a startup command line argument
of the form:
<PRE>
    -ECNoDefaults
</PRE>

<P>
will suppress the reading of these default properties files entirely,
leaving only those properties which are explicitly derived from
the command line.
<P>
A command line argument of the form:
<PRE>
    -ECproperties <I>filename</I>
</PRE>

<P>
will cause property settings to be read from the properties file
named by <I><FONT FACE="Courier">filename</FONT></I>.
<P>
A command line argument of the form:
<PRE>
    <I>name</I>=<I>value</I>
</PRE>

<P>
will be interpreted as a direct property assignment.
<P>
All these property settings are cumulative. That is, you can specify
any number of individual property settings and property files
and they will all be interpreted. Property settings are processed
from left to right and a later setting of a given property will
replace an earlier setting.
<P>
Any command line arguments remaining, after the property setting
arguments are removed, are made available to the application in
an args array.
<P>
For example, if we started the sample application with a command
line like:
<PRE>
    java ec.boot.Boot com.fudco.cool.CoolApp arg1 Checkpoint=D:\foobar.cpt arg2
</PRE>

<P>
then the application would see the command line arguments &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">arg1</FONT>&quot;
and &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">arg2</FONT>&quot; and the &quot;Checkpoint&quot;
property would be set to &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">D:\foobar.cpt</FONT>&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
<H2>Configurability</H2>
<P>
ECDAF applications may be configured from the environment by the
selective setting of properties.<BR>

<P>
<B>Class preloading: &quot;StartupClassPreload&quot; and &quot;PreloadListFile&quot;
</B>
<P>
Class preloading is a feature wherein the startup code forces
the loading of a collection of classes in order to (a) avoid having
to wait for class load later when it might be less convenient
to have a delay, and (b) to get some control over the in-memory
placement of the classes (in terms of ordering and memory packing)
in hopes of improving virtual memory performance. This is a semi-experimental
feature, in that the benefits are somewhat unclear and vary from
case to case. However, the feature is available if you wish to
make use of it.
<P>
Class preloading can be enabled by setting the &quot;StartupClassPreload&quot;
property. If the property is set to the value &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">preload</FONT>&quot;,
the classes will be preloaded directly as part of the startup
sequence. If the property is set to the value &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">background</FONT>&quot;,
the classes will be preloaded in a separate thread that will run
concurrently with the startup sequence. If the property is set
to any other value or if it is not set at all, no class preloading
will be done. In either of the cases where class preloading is
enabled, the value of the property &quot;PreloadList&quot; will
be taken as the name of a file containing a list of the classes
to be preloaded. The format of this file is simple: one line per
class to be preloaded, each line containing one fully qualified
class name.<BR>

<P>
<B>Short-circuiting entropy collection: &quot;DeveloperEntropy&quot;
</B>
<P>
The normal startup sequence goes through various motions to collect
entropy with which to seed the cryptographic random number generator.
Unfortunately, this process takes a bit of time, which can be
especially annoying during program development when frequent restarts
of the application are common and the security value of good random
numbers is small to non-existent. As a development aid, the startup
sequence provides a mechanism to short-circuit this entropy collection
by seeding from some fast but not-highly-unguessable sources.
<P>
The entropy collection short-circuit feature can be enabled by
setting the &quot;DeveloperEntropy&quot; property to &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">true</FONT>&quot;.
Setting it to any other value or not setting it at all will disable
this feature.<BR>

<P>
<B>Customizable login interface: &quot;LoginUIClass&quot;</B>
<P>
Many applications, notably Microcosm, begin with a user login
dialog, to capture a user name and passphrase. Ideally this login
should happen as early in the startup process as possible so as
to avoid making the user wait for all the various initializations
to complete. In addition, the user passphrase can be used to secure
the checkpoint file (see <B>Persistent long-term state</B> below).
The ECDAF startup procedure provides a hook for the application
to provide its own login dialog.
<P>
A custom login dialog can be enabled by setting the property &quot;LoginUIClass&quot;
to the fully qualified class name of an application login dialog
class. Such a class must have a public, zero-argument constructor
and must implement the interface <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.boot.login.LoginPresenter</FONT>.
If the &quot;LoginUIClass&quot; property is not set, no login
dialog will be invoked. Instead, the startup sequence will proceed
with launching the application. However, in the absence of a passphrase,
the application may be unable to run, or at least unable to restore
from its checkpoint file, so take care.
<P>
If &quot;LoginUICLass&quot; <I>is</I> set, the startup code will create
an instance of the login dialog class and then call its <FONT FACE="Courier">login()</FONT>
method:
<PRE>
    public interface LoginPresenter {
        public void login(ec.boot.login.LoginCompletionHandler completion,
                          ec.util.ECProperties properties,
                          ec.boot.login.PassphraseVerifier verifier);
    }
</PRE>

<P>
where <FONT FACE="Courier">completion</FONT> is a call-back object
via which the login dialog indicates the result of the login dialog,
<FONT FACE="Courier">properties</FONT> is the collection of properties
which the startup code has collected (see <B>Properties and Command
Line Arguments</B> above); and <FONT FACE="Courier">verifier</FONT>
is a passphrase verifier which the login dialog can use to check
a passphrase against the checkpoint file.
<P>
The login dialog may do whatever it wishes to capture the user
identity and passphrase (and whatever other information the application
may be interested in getting, for its own purposes, as part of
login). The passphrase verifier should be called if the application
is concerned with using a passphrase-protected checkpoint file.
The passphrase verification interface, <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.boot.login.PassphraseVerifier</FONT>,
is quite simple:
<PRE>
    public interface PassphraseVerifier {
        public boolean verify(String passphrase);
    }
</PRE>

<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">verify</FONT> method will return true
if and only if the given passphrase matches the one associated
with the current checkpoint file (see below).
<P>
The login dialog may also modify the property settings to alter
the application's behavior as it sees fit. In particular, it may
set the &quot;Checkpoint&quot; property to select the checkpoint
file (say, on the basis of the user name). Furthermore, it <I>must</I>
set the &quot;Passphrase&quot; property to indicate the checkpoint
file passphrase, if there is one.
<P>
When the login dialog is finished, it should call the login completion
handler's <FONT FACE="Courier">afterLogin()</FONT> method to inform
the startup code of the outcome. This interface, <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.boot.login.LoginCompletionHandler</FONT>,
is also quite simple:
<PRE>
    public interface LoginCompletionHandler {
        public void afterLogin(boolean success);
    }
</PRE>

<P>
where <FONT FACE="Courier">success</FONT> indicates the success
or failure of the login. Success means that the application should
proceed with the rest of startup. Failure means that the startup
code will immediately exit.<BR>

<P>
<B>User interface selection: &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot;</B>
<P>
The ECDAF is agnostic about the application's user interface or
user interface framework. However, it does have a notion that
the application at least possesses some kind of user interface,
so there is support for this concept in the environment. In particular,
we would like the user interface to be configurable so that alternative
UI implementations may be selected in different contexts (for
example, we often wish to select a GUI for a client-side startup
and a CLI for a server-side startup).
<P>
The user interface framework is selected by setting the &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot;
property to the fully qualified class name of a user interface
framework class. Such a class must have a public, zero-argument
constructor and must implement the interface ec.boot.UIFramework.
If the &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot; property is not set, no UI
framework will be established and the application will be entirely
on its own in the user interface department.
<P>
If the &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot; is set, the startup code will
create an instance of the UI framework class and then call its
<FONT FACE="Courier">init()</FONT> method:
<PRE>
    public interface UIFramework {
        public void init(ec.boot.EEnvironment env);
    }
</PRE>

<P>
where <FONT FACE="Courier">env</FONT> is the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>
that is established as part of the normal application startup.
This is the same <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT> that
is passed to the application startup object in the <FONT FACE="Courier">go()</FONT>
message.
<P>
The UI framework object will itself be placed in the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>
where it will be accessible to the application startup class.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Persistent long-term state: &quot;Checkpoint&quot; and &quot;Passphrase&quot;
</B>
<P>
The ECDAF supports a form of non-orthogonal persistence built
around the concept of a single checkpoint file which captures
all the important state of an application (where &quot;important&quot;
is defined here as being whatever the application considers worth
saving plus the information that ECDAF itself needs to save to
keep working). The persistence mechanism per se is accessed via
the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT> and will be explained
in more detail below. However, property settings control the mechanism's
general behavior.
<P>
The persistence mechanism can be enabled by setting the &quot;Checkpoint&quot;
property to the name of a checkpoint file. This can name either
an existing checkpoint file somewhere on the computer or a checkpoint
file that has yet to be created. If the &quot;Checkpoint&quot;
property is not set, the execution of the application will be
considered ephemeral and it will not be able to save its state.
<P>
If the checkpoint file does not exist at startup time, a new persistent
ECDAF process will be created, including a new <FONT FACE="Courier">VatIdentity</FONT>
and an empty <FONT FACE="Courier">Registrar</FONT> table, and
the application's state will be null. If the checkpoint file exists,
it will be deserialized to yield the previously saved application
state, <FONT FACE="Courier">VatIdentity</FONT>, and so on.
<P>
The checkpoint file may be passphrase protected. If so, the file
will be saved in encrypted form using a passphrase to generated
the encryption key. The operation of restoring from this checkpoint
file at application startup time will then require this same passphrase
in order to succeed in decrypting the file. The passphrase for
decrypting and encrypting the checkpoint file may be specified
by setting the &quot;Passphrase&quot; property. If this property
is not set or if it is set to the empty string (<FONT FACE="Courier">&quot;&quot;</FONT>),
the file will be saved in unencrypted form. And if the passphrase
is null, startup will only succeed if directed to an unencrypted
checkpoint file.
<P>
Note that by setting the &quot;Checkpoint&quot; and &quot;Passphrase&quot;
properties while omitting to set the &quot;LoginUIClass&quot;
property, it is possibly to startup an ECDAF application non-interactively,
even if would normally have an interactive login.<BR>

<P>
<B>Participation in the networked world: &quot;ListenAddress&quot;
and &quot;SearchPath&quot;</B>
<P>
In order to be a fully functional networked application, it is
generally necessary not only to be able to communicate with other
entities on the net but to enable them to communicate with you.
To this end, the data communications subsystem needs two critical
pieces of configuration information: what address and port to
listen for incoming connections on, and what information to provide
to others (for example, in SturdyRefs) to enable them to locate
the application's process in the future.
<P>
The network address and port upon which to listen for incoming
connections is specified by setting the &quot;ListenAddress&quot;
property. This property should be set to a string of the form:
<PRE>
    <I>domainname</I>:<I>portnumber</I> 
</PRE>

<P>
or simply
<PRE>
    <I>domainname</I>
</PRE>

<P>
where <I><FONT FACE="Courier">domainname</FONT></I> is the either
an Internet domain name or dotted-quad IP address; and <I><FONT FACE="Courier">portnumber</FONT></I>
is the (decimal integer) port number. If the port number is omitted,
it defaults to 0. If the &quot;ListenAddress&quot; property is
not set at all, it will default to the local host name, or &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">localhost</FONT>&quot;
if the local host name cannot be determined. Confusingly, however,
the <I><FONT FACE="Courier">domainname</FONT></I> portion of the
address will be ignored for purposes of setting up data communications;
the network address being listened upon will always be that of
the computer that the application is running on (as it should
be). For example, our sample application might specify a listen
address of:
<PRE>
    coolserv.fudco.com:2347
</PRE>

<P>
which would indicate that the domain name is &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">coolserv.fudco.com</FONT>&quot;
and the port number is 2347.
<P>
An ECDAF process is located in the network using a &quot;search
path&quot;. This is simply a list of network addresses which are
tried in sequence as either plausible candidates for the actual
process host machine itself or as the addresses of Process Location
Servers (PLSs) which might know the actual address. When an application
starts up, it is given such a search path that should be usable
for finding itself. The <FONT FACE="Courier">Registrar</FONT>
that the startup process creates will use this search path in
constructing any <FONT FACE="Courier">SturdyRef</FONT>s which
the application creates. In addition, as part of startup, each
of the elements in the search path will be treated as the possible
address of a PLS and the communications subsystem will attempt
to register the ECDAF process with each of them (and, as long
as the process continues to execute, will periodically refresh
these registrations so that they don't expire).
<P>
The search path is specified by setting the &quot;SearchPath&quot;
property. The value of the &quot;SearchPath&quot; property should
consist of one or more network addresses in the form described
above for the &quot;ListenAddress&quot; property. Multiple addresses
should be separated by semicolon (&quot;<FONT FACE="Courier">;</FONT>&quot;)
characters. Our example thus might have a search path something
like:
<PRE>
    coolserv.fudco.com:2347;pls.fudco.com;pls.communities.com 
</PRE>

<P>
which would first direct someone to a plausible address for the
process itself, then have them check with the FUDCO PLS and then
the Electric Communities PLS. Upon startup the process would register
itself with these two PLSs.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Core System Services</H2>
<P>
The final important function of the ECDAF startup code is to initialize
the core system services and make them available to the application.
These services are all encapsulated by the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>
object which is passed to the application in the <FONT FACE="Courier">go()</FONT>
message. All these services are then usable either directly via
methods on the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT> object
itself or via capabilities which can be obtained from the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>
object.<BR>

<P>
<B>Properties and command line arguments</B>
<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT> provides access to
the command line arguments and the property settings. Command
line arguments are obtainable via the method:
<PRE>
    String[] args();
</PRE>

<P>
which returns the arguments in an array. If there were no command
line arguments the result will be a 0 element array.
<P>
Access to the properties is via a set of methods which echo the
read-only portion of the <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.util.ECProperties</FONT>
method protocol. That is, entities with access to the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>
can interrogate the property settings but may not modify them.
The methods available are:
<PRE>
    String getProperty(String key);
    String getProperty(String key, String defaultValue);
    int intProperty(String key, int defaultValue);
    boolean testProperty(String key);
    Enumeration propertyNames();
</PRE>

<P>
see the Javadoc for <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.util.ECProperties</FONT>
for full descriptions of these.<BR>

<P>
<B>Persistence</B>
<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT> provides access to
the persistent data storage mechanism. In addition to the information
which ECDAF saves for its own use, the application may specify
an arbitrary Serializable object of its own which is to be saved.
This object should be the root of a reference graph of objects
which encompasses all state that the application cares to have
persisted. The method:
<PRE>
    void setApplicationStateBundle(Serializable bundle);
</PRE>

<P>
specifies the object which is to fill this role (i.e., be saved
when the application persists), while the method:
<PRE>
    Serializable applicationStateBundle();
</PRE>

<P>
returns the object which is currently in this role. Upon application
startup, this can be interrogated to determine if the startup
is a restore from checkpoint. If <FONT FACE="Courier">applicationStateBundle()</FONT>
returns null, then either this is a freshly minted ECDAF process
or the process persisted with no application-relevant state (which
is functionally the same thing from the application's point of
view).
<P>
The methods:
<PRE>
    void commit();
    void commit(StableStoreWatcher watcher);
</PRE>

<P>
cause the current state of the ECDAF process (including the application
state bundle if there is one) to be serialized to the checkpoint
file. The second form of the method allows you to specify an object
which will be asynchronously notified when the checkpoint completes
(see the Javadoc for <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.persist.StableStoreWatcher</FONT>
for details).
<P>
As discussed above under <B>Persistent long-term state</B>, the
checkpoint file can be protected with a passphrase. The method:
<PRE>
    String passphrase();
</PRE>

<P>
returns the passphrase currently being used, while the method:
<PRE>
    void setPassphrase(String passphrase);
</PRE>

<P>
changes the passphrase, including rewriting the checkpoint file
with the new encryption key.<BR>

<P>
<B>Core Service capabilities</B>
<P>
The ECDAF sets up a variety of services that are accessed by capabilities
available from the <FONT FACE="Courier">EEnvironment</FONT>. The
methods:
<PRE>
    DirectoryRootMaker directoryRootMaker();
    ProxyManager proxyManager();
    Registrar registrar();
    UIFramework uiFramework(); 
</PRE>

<P>
return these various capabilities: the capability-oriented file
system root, the proxy manager (which is actually the main capability
to the communications subsystem), the Registrar and the user interface
framework. Consult the Javadoc for the various classes (<FONT FACE="Courier">ec.file.DirectoryRootMaker</FONT>,
<FONT FACE="Courier">ec.elib.net.proxy.ProxyManager</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.elib.net.proxy.Registrar</FONT>,
and <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.boot.UIFramework</FONT>) for more
detail on these capabilities and their use.<BR>

Evaluation of JavaSafe</H1>
<B>Last Updated</B>:&nbsp; 5/27/98

<P><B>Author</B>:&nbsp; <A HREF="mailto:slewis@communities.com">Scott Lewis</A>
<H2>
Introduction</H2>
JavaSafe is a source code control system being offerred from JavaSoft.&nbsp;
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javasafe/">Here is the home page</A>.

<P><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javasafe/JavaSafe_Buy.html">Cost
structure for JavaSafe is provided here</A>.&nbsp; It is not free.
<BR><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javasafe/JavaSafe_FAQ.html">FAQ
is here</A>.&nbsp; Some decent information is here.

<P>According to the FAQ, CVS is based upon RCS, and JavaSafe looks significantly
like CVS (for example, it uses the same Copy, Modify, Merge strategy as
CVS.

<P>They have <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javasafe/JavaSafe_Cool.html">emacs
additions</A> to allow integration with JavaSafe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like
a nice feature for you emacs fans out there.

<P>They have a <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javasafe/JavaSafe_Request.html">feature
request mechanism on the web</A> which looks nice.&nbsp; Don't know how
responsive they will be, however.

<P>Some <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javasafe/JavaSafe_Screens.html">screen
shots</A>.&nbsp; GUI looks OK IMHO, but perhaps a little immature.
<H3>
Recommendation</H3>
Looks like JavaSafe is potentially a useful product.&nbsp; Given that we
are working reasonably effectively with CVS at this point, that JavaSafe
is an unknown quantity, and that JavaSafe costs real money (~6K for 25
site license) my recommendation is that we <B>not</B> switch to JavaSafe
at this time.&nbsp; It's technical advantages over CVS at this point (real
GUI, some potential for cool features using java server, etc.) are mostly
unrealized...and doesn't provide a huge technical advantage over CVS for
us right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also it is a very early product, and doesn't
have much usage experience behind it yet.&nbsp; It is therefore likely
to be relatively unreliable.

<P>It would be a good idea to track its progress, however, and if it becomes
a clear winner over CVS at some point, then we could consider switching
to it.&nbsp; I will track its progress over time.

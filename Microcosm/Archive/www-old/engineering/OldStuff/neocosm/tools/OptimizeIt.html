<h1>Installing and running OptimizeIt 2.01 Professional.</h1>
</body>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Install it. You can find the self-extracting installation 
<A HREF="file:\\alexandria\eng\win32\OptimizeIt\\OptIt201P.exe">here</A>. 
When you click on that link, your system should prompt you to download 
file names OptIt201P.exe. Do so. Remember where you save it. It'd be nice
if the browser would just run it, but... <br>
BTW, if the link doesn't work for you, you can find it on the unix servers
in /home/eng/win32/OptimizeIt/.
<li>
Using the Windows Explorer (or your favorite command prompt), navigate to
where you saved it, and run it. This should start the OptimizeIt installation
process.
<li>
At the "User Information" dialog box, enter one of our serial numbers.
Either <strong>970884</strong> or <strong>970885</strong>. You can 
leave <strong>Administrator</strong> as the user, or put your own name,
or whatever you want.
<li>
The next dialog box is the "Choose Destination Location". I recommend
using the browse button and setting the installation directory to
<strong>the root of your development drive</strong>. For example, "c:\".
This will install OptimizeIt in "c:\OptimizeIt", and that'll make your
life easier when it's time to add it to your PATH and CLASSPATH.

<li>
Finish the installation. 
<li>
At this point, you've got an "OptimizeIt 2.01 Professional" entry in your
start menu. 
</ol>
<h2> Using it.  </h2>

There are 2 official ways to use OptimizeIt to examine a java program. You
can either A) start your application from inside of OptimizeIt (ie. use
OptimizeIt's GUI tool to select and start your program), or B) run your
application separately and attach OptimizeIt to it. Personally, I prefer
to attach to a running program.

<h3>Running your program from inside of OptimizeIt</h3>
By default, when you first run OptimizeIt, it'll pop up the Program Choose
window. This is where you set the working directory, main class, CLASSPATH,
and java options. Unfortunately, it doesn't let you set the PATH variable, so
if your application depends on custom .dlls that aren't in the system or working
directory, you're slightly hosed. Cosm has this problem. One way around it is
to run OptimizeIt from the command line, in a command prompt window that already
has the environment set. For example, in your 4DOS BUILD or RELEASE window (
or whatever window you have that already has an appropriate CLASSPATH and PATH,
etc), you could type <pre>"c:\OptimizeIt\OptimizeIt.exe"</pre> and it'll come
up, inheriting the proper environment from your window. <p>
Once it's up with the appropriate environment, you can set the properties you
need. An example of how to run r167 from \build\release would be:
<pre>
 - Select Application (not applet)
 - Program main class: "ec.e.boot.ELogin" 
 - Program working directory: "c:\build\release\"
 - Select "Open a console"
 - Extra Java parameters: "-ms6m -mx48m"
 - Extra program parameters: "ec.pl.runtime.Agency -ECproperties props/run.props"
</pre> 

You shouldn't have to add to the CLASSPATH since your environment was inherited.
Pressing the "Start Now" button should start Cosm. 

<h3>Attaching OptimizeIt to an already running program</h3>
OptimizeIt has a fairly painless way to audit a separate Java process. To do this,
you need to do 3 things. In your favorite command prompt window, with the 
environment already set so you can run the application you want to audit:
<ol>
<li>
Add OptimizeIt to your PATH. Do this like so:
<pre> set PATH=%PATH%;c:\OptimizeIt\;c:\OptimizeIt\lib </pre>
<li>
Add OptimizeIt to your CLASSPATH
<pre> set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;c:\OptimizeIt\lib\classes </pre>
<li>
Start your java process via OptimizeIt's intuitive.audit.Audit class. For example,
if you would have run your program like this:
<pre>[c:\mydir] java -ms6m MainClass Arg1 Arg2</pre>
You would instead do:
<pre>[c:\mydir] java -ms6m intuitive.audit.Audit MainClass Arg1 Arg2</pre>
</ol>

At this point, your program will start running and will spam out something like
<pre>
OptimizeIt 2.0 audit system. (c) 1997,1998 Intuitive Systems Inc.
Port is 1470
</pre>

This tells you that your app is running, and can be attached to by OptimizeIt.
Now, start OptimizeIt via your Start Menu. Use the "Program/Attach" menu to 
attach to your application.

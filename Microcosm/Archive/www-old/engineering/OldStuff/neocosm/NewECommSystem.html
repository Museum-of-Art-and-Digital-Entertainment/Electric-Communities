<H1>New E Data Comm System</H1>

<P><B>Last updated:</B><I> </I>[98/07/07 Bill]<BR>
[98/9/15 Bill] Added link to E Data Comm System Throught Firewalls.<BR>
[98/11/23 Bill] Update for change in the connectionDead method interface.</P>

<P>Author: <A HREF="mailto:frantz@communities.com">Bill Frantz</A> </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This system performs the basic byte array transport between &quot;vats&quot;
for the New E runtime. It is also responsible for connection establishment
and tear down; and confidentiality and authentication of the data sent
on the connections.</P>

<P>A vat is the part of the Neocosm implementation that has a unique network
identity. We expect that normal circumstances, there will only be one vat
running on a particular machine at one time. Neocom currently (28 May 1998)
supports only one avatar per vat.</P>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>The basic requirements of the Data Comm system are; connection management,
reliability, ordering, encryption, authentication, and network location
independence. These, and other requirements, are discussed in more detail
below.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Connection management: The Data Comm system will maintain a list of
current connections. It will build new connections as needed. It will tear
down connections when requested. It will accept new connections from other
vats.</LI>

<LI>Wire protocol: The Data Comm system will define the basic wire protocol.
Certain parts of the protocol (e.g. insertion of the <A HREF="#message-type">message
type numbers</A>) may be implemented by users of the Data Comm system.</LI>

<LI>Data Streaming: The Data Comm system will provide a primitive sufficient
to support a streaming protocol for long messages. This will be designed
with needs of art down loading in mind.</LI>

<LI>Reliability and ordering: The Data Comm system will provide &quot;reliable&quot;
message transport with sufficent ordering to implement the E ordering guarantees.</LI>

<LI>Exception handling: The Data Comm system will provide sufficient error
reporting so that the E runtime can correctly implement its &quot;broken
promise&quot; logic. In addition, it will maintain a log of unusual events
to aid in debugging the communication problems that will inevitability
be encountered by Neocosm users.</LI>

<LI>Multicast support: The Data Comm system will cooperate with other software
to support a &quot;send to multiple objects&quot; abstraction. This cooperation
includes point to point message delivery, and link failure notification.</LI>

<LI>Secure Authenticated Links: The Data Comm system will implement authenticated,
confidential links between E &quot;vats&quot; running on the same or different
machines. </LI>

<LI>Network location independence: The Data Comm system will cooperate
with one or more PLSs to allow an identity to move from one network address
to another. </LI>

<LI>Firewall support: The Data Comm system will allow users to operate
through certain kinds of firewall.</LI>

<LI>Kill Dead Connections: Connections will be periodically checked to
ensure they are still working.</LI>

<LI>Build a authenticated connection to the vat at an arbitrary IP&nbsp;address.
The initial user of this feature will be PLS registration.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<P>Conceptual objects</P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>VatIdentity </TT>the serializable class which holds the public/private
keys that define the identity of the vat. It's <TT>getConnectionsManager
</TT>method is how the <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>is created.<FONT SIZE=-1>
(Thanks to Arturo Bejar for the suggestion of separating the infrequently
changing vat identity code, which must be saved, from the more frequently
changing communications code which can be recreated after every restart
of the application.)</FONT></LI>

<LI><TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>which manages all the connections.</LI>

<LI><TT>DataConnection </TT>which implements a single (TCP) connection.</LI>

<LI><TT>ListenThread </TT>which listens for new incoming connections.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Connection establishment and tear down</P>

<UL>
<P><A NAME="getConnection"></A>The <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>implements
a method: <TT>public DataConnection getConnection(String registrarID, String[]
plsList)</TT> which either returns an existing DataConnection, or creates
a new one and starts it building a network connection. <TT>registrarID
</TT>is the hash of the public key of the desired vat, and <TT>plsList
</TT>is an array of PLS locations to try in attempting to locate that vat.
The PLS locations are &lt;IP address:port number&gt; e.g. <TT>&quot;george.communities.com:1670&quot;</TT>.</P>

<P>Because of the need to build an authenticated connection to the vat
at an arbitrary IP address, the <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>also implements
<TT>Promise connectToVatAt(String ipPort)</TT>. <TT>ipPort </TT>is &lt;IP
address:port number&gt; as above. If a remote vat is listening at that
IP:port address, then the <TT>Promise </TT>will be forwarded to the <TT>DataConnection
</TT>when the remote vat has been identified. If a connection error occurs
before the remote vat is identified, then the Promise will be &quot;smashed&quot;.
Since this connection is a full fledged E-vat to E-vat connection, the
<TT>NewConnectionNoticer </TT>registered with <TT><A HREF="#registerNewConnectionNoticer">registerNewConnectionNoticer()</A></TT>
will be called to hook up the normal E connection services.</P>

<P>The <TT>ConnectionsManager</TT> implements a registration method <TT>public
void <A NAME="registerNewConnectionNoticer"></A>registerNewConnectionNoticer(NewConnectionNoticer
noticer)</TT>. It will call the object registered for each new DataConnection
with public <TT>void noticeNewConnection(DataConnection connection)</TT>.
This call is designed to allow higher levels to register their <A HREF="#Receiving">message
handlers</A> on new inbound connections.</P>

<P>To allow all the necessary &quot;plumbing&quot; to be connected when
a connection is established, the DataConnection object will not send or
receive any high level data until the <TT>noticeNewConnection </TT>method
of the registered <TT><A HREF="#registerNewConnectionNoticer">NewConnectionNoticer
</A></TT>has returned. This method should ensure that all the necessary
<A HREF="#Receiving">message handlers</A> have been registered.</P>

<P>Each <TT>DataConnection </TT>implements a method: <TT>public void shutDownConnection()</TT>
which closes the connection. After this call the <TT>DataConnection </TT>object
is no longer usable and should be discarded so it can be garbage collected.</P>
</UL>

<P>Sending Data</P>

<UL>
<P>Each <TT>DataConnection </TT>implements two methods: <TT>public void
sendMsg(byte[] message) throws IOException </TT>and <TT>public void sendMsg(byte[]
message, Runnable notification, Runner placeToRun) throws IOException</TT>.</P>

<P>In both cases, <TT>message </TT>is the message to be sent. It must not
be altered after the call to <TT>sendMsg</TT>. The first byte of <TT>message
</TT>is the <A NAME="message-type"></A>message type and must be chosen
from the types defined in the definition class <TT>Msg</TT>. (These two
restrictions allow <TT>sendMsg </TT>to avoid copying the message into a
private buffer.) </P>

<P>A further restriction will be that there must be a <A HREF="#Receiving">handler</A>
registered for the message type. This restriction will allow sendMsg to
use the handler data structure to validate sends. If this restriction is
a problem it is easy to remove, but it seems to be a reasonable one give
the symetric nature of the communication protocols.</P>

<PRE><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>/* Message type codes. */

    static final String[] Version     = {&quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;}; // E protocol versions supported

    static final byte PROTOCOL_VERSION  = 1;  // Initial message followed by version string above

<P>Parameter <TT>notification </TT>is a <TT>Runnable </TT>that will be
enqueued using <TT>placeToRun.enqueue(notification)</TT> after <TT>message
</TT>has been placed in the network output queue. If some error prevents
<TT>message </TT>from being sent, <TT>notification </TT>may not be queued.
This mechanism allows code outside the Data Comm system to implement a
data streaming protocol with flow control for large data transfers. A suggested
use is to start streaming by calling <TT>sendMsg </TT>two or three times
with the initial blocks of the stream. The <TT>notification </TT>includes
the next block number to send. The <TT>Runnable </TT>fetches that block,
calculates the next block and calls <TT>sendMsg </TT>with the appropriate
parameters to continue the stream.</P>

<P>If there is a problem with the connection which prevents the message
from being sent, <TT>IOException </TT>will be thrown. See <A HREF="#Failure">Failure
Notification</A> for the fine print.</P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="Receiving"></A>Receiving Data</P>

<UL>
<P>Each <TT>DataConnection </TT>implements a method: <TT>public void registerMsgHandler(int
msgType, MsgHandler handler) throws IOException</TT>. The parameter <TT>msgType
</TT>is the message type to be handled (from <TT>MsgTypes</TT>). An attempt
to register more than one handler for a message type, or to register for
an invalid message type will throw an exception. The parameter <TT>handler
</TT>is an object which will handle the message data. It will be called
with: <TT>void processMessage(byte[] message, DataConnection connection)</TT>where
<TT>message </TT>is the only reference to the byte array, and connection
is the DataConnection object which received the message. Note that one
handler can process more than one message type by selecting on the first
byte of the message. One handler can process more than one connection by
selecting based on the DataConnection object passed.</P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="Failure"></A>Failure Notification</P>

<UL>
<P>There are at least two queues between the <TT>DataConnection </TT>and
the network hardware. One is maintained as part of the <TT>DataConnection
</TT>and allows <TT>sendMessage </TT>to be non-blocking. The other is maintained
as part of the JavaVM/Platform TCP implementation. Senders are only notified
of problems known before the message is placed in the <TT>DataConnection
</TT>output queue. If a problem occurs when a message is in either of the
output queues, the message is silently discarded. However, any failure
to deliver an outbound message will cause the connection to be terminated.
This termination will notify the input message handlers.</P>

<P>If the sender is notified of a connection problem, the notification
will be by having the call to <TT>sendMessage </TT>throw an <TT>IOException</TT>.</P>

<P>Input message handlers will be notified of connection termination by:
<TT>void connectionDead(DataConnection connection, Throwable reason)</TT>
being called. <TT>reason </TT>is a Throwable which describes why the connection
died. </P>
</UL>

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>

<P>Using SSL has been rejected. See <A HREF="SSLvsEComm.html">SSL vs. E
Comm</A> for the reasons.</P>

<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>

<P>The bug in the current connection set up protocol which allows a man-in-the-middle
to eliminate encryption by modifing the crypto negoition should be fixed
by verifing a hash of all the startup protocol messages after authentication
has been set up.</P>

<H2>Current implementation</H2>

<P>This design is a simpilification of the r167 system. Basic code that
will come over mostly unchanged includes the encryption, send and receive
threads, message queuing, Trace log error handling, and startup protocol
negoition.</P>

<P>The new design will have two threads per link instead of three (the
function of RawConnection being taken over elsewhere). There will be many
fewer classes and objects per connection. The main bodies of code should
fairly clearly follow the conceptual objects described above. 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>The following description written 6/22/98 - Bill</P>

<P>The code consists of the following major classes:</P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>VatIdentity </TT>- Owns the public/private keys which define the
identity of the vat.</LI>

<LI><TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>- Manages the connections from this vat
to other vats.</LI>

<LI><TT>DataConnection </TT>- Manages one logical connection from this
vat to a single other vat.</LI>

<LI><TT>DataPath </TT>- Manages a single (TCP) connection. DataPaths can
come and go with suspend/resume events and crossed connections while the
<TT>DataConnection </TT>persists.</LI>

<LI><TT>SendThread </TT>- A separate thread which sends data to the TCP
socket. It is a separate thread to allow sends to be non-blocking.</LI>

<LI><TT>RecvThread </TT>- A spearate thread to listen to the socket for
incoming messages. It is a separate thread to allow vat processing of other
events while waiting for an incoming message.</LI>

<LI><TT>ListenThread </TT>- A separate thread to listen for new TCP connections.
There is one instance of this thread for each identity.</LI>

<LI><TT>StartUpProtocol </TT>- Handles the start up protocol for the connection.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Startup, Shutdown, and Steady State</B></P>

<P>The construction starts with a <TT>VatIdentity </TT>object which has
either been instantiated or restored from a checkpoint. We further assume
that it has been called for the instance of it's <TT>ConnectionsManager
</TT>so the connections manager has been built. As part of building the
connections manager, the <TT>ListenThread </TT>has been created and started.</P>

<P>The object of startup is to create the objects needed for the steady
state. The object of shutdown is to clean up the steady state. Because
of these objectives, I will describe the steady state first.</P>

<P>Steady State</P>

<P>There is a <TT>DataConnection </TT>object which is connected to the
higher-level things. That <TT>DataConnection </TT>object is connected to
a <TT>DataPath </TT>object which is connected to a <TT>SendThread </TT>and
a <TT>RecvThread</TT>. The <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>has the <TT>DataConnection
</TT>object registered in its list of running connections.</P>

<P>Startup Protocol</P>

<P>The startup protocol is handled by <TT>StartUpProtocol</TT>. It identifies
the remote vat and sets up the secure connection. The startup protocol
has four possible outcomes which are signaled by calling appropriate methods
in it's associated DataPath object.</P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>abandonAllConnectionAttempts </TT>- Used when this connection is
the one of a pair of crossed connections which will be closed.</LI>

<LI><TT>tryNext </TT>- Used to try the next address in the search path.
This is the return that is used after getting an address from the PLS or
if a location fails to respond or has an error.</LI>

<LI><TT>resumeConnection </TT>- Used to try to resume a connection. The
suspendID presented by the remote end must match the local copy.</LI>

<LI><TT>startupSuccessful </TT>- Used when the startup protocol has successfully
completed and the connection is ready for higher level data.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Outbound Search Strategy</P>

<P>The request to create a new outbound connection, <TT><A HREF="#getConnection">getConnection</A>,
</TT>takes a parameter which is the list of addresses to try in order to
locate the remote vat. These addresses will be tried in the order presented.
They can be either the expected address of the vat, or the address of a
PLS the vat may register with. If the address is a PLS, it can return a
new address to try in response to the <A HREF="DataComm_startup.html">start
up protocol</A> request for the registrarID. That address will be tried
before the next address in the list passed to <TT>getConnection()</TT>.
No address will be tried more than once. </P>

<P>If the address is not a PLS, either there is nothing listening at the
remote address, there is a non-E system listening, there is some other
vat listening, or it is the address of the desired vat. If there is nothing
listening, then the TCP socket build will fail, and the next address will
be tried. If there is a non-E system listening, then either it will perform
an illegal start up protocol operation, or the start up will timeout. If
it is some other vat, it will respond NOT_ME to the start up protocol.
If it is the desired vat, the start up protocol will succeed and the connection
will be made, or the two ends will be unable to agree on a version of the
E comm protocol/encryption technique, and the attempt will fail. In this
last case, the other addresses in the list will be tried.</P>

<P><A NAME="OutboundStartup"></A>Outbound Startup</P>

<P>The <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>has been called for a connection to
a remote vat. It has determined that no existing connection exists. It
creates a new <TT>DataConnection </TT>object which in turn creates a <TT>DataPath
</TT>object and a <TT>StartUpProtocol </TT>object. The <TT>DataPath </TT>object
creates a <TT>SendThread </TT>which builds a TCP connection to the first
address in the search path and then creates a <TT>RecvThread</TT>. The
<TT>StartUpProtocol </TT>object sends messages to initiate the startup
protocol. If the first address is not the requested vat, the <TT>DataPath</TT>,
<TT>StartUpProtocol</TT>, <TT>SendThread</TT>, and <TT>RecvThread </TT>are
closed and the process continues by building a <TT>DataPath </TT>object
for the next address in the search list.</P>

<P>Inbound Startup</P>

<P>The <TT>ListenThread </TT>receives the incoming socket and passes it
to the <TT>ConnectionsManager</TT>. The <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>creates
a <TT>DataPath </TT>object to perform the startup protocol with this socket.
When the startup protocol has proceeded far enough to identify the remote
vat, the <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>is used to either connect it to an
existing <TT>DataConnection </TT>object or to create a new one. If it is
connected to an existing <TT>DataConnection </TT>object, there may be a
crossed connection to contend with. If there is a crossed connection, the
two <TT>StartUpProtocol </TT>objects work through the two <TT>DataPath
</TT>objects and the single <TT>DataConnection </TT>object to resolve the
connection down to only one <TT>DataPath </TT>object.</P>

<P>Shutdown</P>

<P>When a request to shutdown the connection is received by the <TT>DataConnection</TT>,
it sends a shutdown message to the other end. It will not send any new
messages after it has sent the shutdown message. When the other end receives
the shutdown message, it notifies its registered <TT>MsgHandler </TT>objects
that the connection has shut down and echos the shut down message. It then
closes the socket, destroys the <TT>SendThread</TT>, and <TT>RecvThread</TT>,
and notifies its <TT>DataConnection </TT>that it is dead. When the connection
that originated the shutdown receives the shutdown message, it performs
the same cleanup.</P>

<P>Suspend </P>

<P>Suspend is similar to shutdown except that the <TT>DataConnection </TT>remains
in suspended state instead of becoming dead. Any attempt to send a message
on a suspended <TT>DataConnection </TT>object will initiate a new connection
attempt as in <A HREF="#OutboundStartup">Outbound Startup</A>.</P>

<P>Resume</P>

<P>Resume is very much like startup. Part way thru the startup protocol,
a resume message informs the other end that the operation is a resumption.
The resuming vat presents it's suspendID. If the ID matches the one stored
locally, the connection is resumed. If it does not match, or none has been
generated locally, the connection is not resumed. If there is a suspended
connection with that identity, it is shutdown.</P>

<H4>Resolved Issues</H4>

<P><I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I> </P>

<LI>[as of 6/15/98] There is no way to connect an incoming connection to
the higher levels (multi-comm, object-com, proxy-comm). This issue is resolved
by the addition of the <A HREF="#registerNewConnectionNoticer">registerNewConnectionNoticer
</A>method.</LI>

<LI>[as of 6/15/98] There is a race condition for outgoing connections
where the startup protocol can complete before the higher levels have registered
their listeners. If this occurs, incoming messages may be dropped (with
error spam). This issue is resolved with the introduction of the <A HREF="#enable">enable()</A>&nbsp;method
on the DataConnection. [7/7/98]Upon reflection, the enable method is unnecessary.
The ConnectionsManager is notified that the connection is RUNNING when
the last start up protocol message is processed. It calls the registered
NewConnectionNoticer as a result of that notification. It can register
the MsgHandlers before it returns which is before the RecvThread can introduce
new messages into the DataPath/DataConnection (since the RecvThread is
busy while the last start up message finishes being processed.)</LI>

<H4>Open Issues</H4>

<UL>
<LI>In 1.1.3, Java appears to get the IP address of the machine once at
startup. In the case of someone running Microcosm who is dropped by their
ISP, they get a new IP&nbsp;address when they re-dial. We need to deal
with this problem one way or another.</LI>

<P>Jeff says, &quot;Getting the IP address on windows is no problem. I've
done a bunch a work with winsock. We could just add something to &lt;shudder&gt;
native.dll.&quot;</P>

<LI>You can't get the IP address of the local machine unless it is connected
(duh). Eric reported this as a problem that had to be worked around in
the r167 comm system. He also reported that the work around wasn't complete.</LI>

<LI>In r167, you can't perform in-world operations (e.g. build a turf)
without being connected. Randy says we need to fix this. The fix is probably
outside the Data Comm system level.</LI>

<LI>I (wsf) currently believe that the data streaming protocol described
above will be sufficient to solve the art downloading problem. It will
limit the delay in transmitting other E messages to the length of a small
number of art blocks. If that is not sufficient, we can add a second, low
priority, output queue which is served only when the high priority queue
is empty.</LI>

<LI>Sidney suggests having a way to configure the &quot;listen&quot; address
(IP + port number) during PLS registration to handle certain proxying firewalls.</LI>

<LI>Does LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) have any application
to our PLS requirements?</LI>

<LI>[as of 6/15/98] The reconnection of suspend connections is messy. A
connection which is being resumed needs to be connected to the old DataConnection
object so that object's clients are unaware of the suspend/resume. In R167
this was handled with two objects, but it would be nice to avoid the overhead
of the extra method invocations multiple objects require.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Thread Handling</B></P>

<P>Each communication connection seems to need to juggle three threads.
They are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The Vat thread</LI>

<LI>The send thread - which allows non-blocking sends</LI>

<LI>The receive thread - which monitors the connection for input</LI>
</UL>

<P>The send and receive threads need to communicate with objects inside
the vat for several reasons. These reasons include: updating comm statistics,
new messages available for processing, error reporting, progress of send
operations (the data streaming), and shutdown progress.</P>

<P>The E vat code provides two techniques for threads outside the vat to
synchronize with the vat and communicate with in-vat objects. Both of these
are implemented in ec.elib.prim.Runner. They are:</P>

<P><TT>public Object callNow(Object rec, String verb, Object[] args) throws
Throwable; </TT>Which does a normal E style CRAPI call of rec.verb(arg...)
and</P>

<P><TT>public Object now(Thunk todo) throws Throwable; </TT>Which calls
the &quot;Object run()&quot; method in todo which implements Thunk.</P>

<P>In the r167 version, the external threads simply grabbed the vat lock
and then used their reference to the in-vat objects to call directly.<BR>
<BR>
The E techniques both have performance implications: callNow does: <TT>return
now(new CallThunk(rec, verb, args));</TT> And CallThunk saves the arguments
and does an E.call with them in its run method.</P>

<P>Using now(...) directly increases class bloat with a Thunk for each
method called, or has an obscure switch function in one common DataCommThunk
class.</P>

<P>In both cases, some extra objects are created and made garbage to acomplish
the call. Is tight control of the vat lock (in Runner) worth the cost in
object creation and extra classes?</P>

<P>The version as of 6/16/98 uses a single thunk with the messy switch
statement for communication from the <TT>SendThread </TT>and <TT>RecvThread
</TT>to the <TT>DataConnection</TT>. The CRAPI interface is used to notify
the <TT>ConnectionsManager </TT>of newly arrived <TT>Sockets</TT>.</P>

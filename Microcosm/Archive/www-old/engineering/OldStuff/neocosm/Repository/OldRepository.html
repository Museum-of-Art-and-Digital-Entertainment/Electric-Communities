<H2>Introduction</H2>

[98/07/08 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>]
The Old Repository was apparently accessed only through
<A HREF="OldDataHolders.html#DataHolder">DataHolder(Steward)s</A>.
These, in turn, were only accessed from
<A HREF="#SuperRepository">SuperRepositories</A> and
<A HREF="#PublishRepository">PublishRepositories</A>.

<P>Given this design, I hope I don't have to change the
<A HREF="OldDataHolders.html">current DataHolders</A> as part of the
Repository rewrite.

<A name="SimpleRepository"></A>
<H4>SimpleRepository (Interface)</H4>

The basic interface for Repositories which deals with retrieving simple
objects from a local (i.e. not on the net) Repository.

<P>A SimpleRepository knows how to retrieve simple objects locally.
An object is simple if it does not need any support at decode time
such as a perimeter object table or decoding properties table.

<A name="RepositoryFile"></A>
<H4>RepositoryFile (Class)</H4>

A RepositoryFile contains (Java) objects, encoded using
Openers.  First in the RepositoryFile, in fixed file-positions,
are some specially treated data in what is called the FileInfo
block, such as the RepositoryFile Version number, and
information that allows us to retrieve the keys for the file.<p>

<P>Each record in the file contains both the key and the data,
encoded using Openers. This allows us to recover the keys in a
file by reading the whole file sequentially. However, each file
normally contains a Dictionary of keys, that is stored at the end
of the file. This Vector is saved under the reserved key
"%LocalKeyVector%", just to keep all data in the file conform
to a key-data pairing scheme. At startup, the Vector is read
in and the values are distributed into a Dictionary (we use a
Hashtable or a SimTable).  Note that when we want to add more
data to the file, which is done by appending, then we will
overwrite this Vector and will re-write it only when we close
the file. The special information (in the beginning of the
file) is updated to reflect this in such a way that it is never
inconsistent.

<A name="Repository"></A>
<H4>Repository (Class)</H4>

Implements <A HREF="#SimpleRepository">SimpleRepository</A>.

<P>A Repository is a subsystem that manages access to a small
number of data files known as <A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>.
Each Repository can thus have several files, and each running system may use
several Repositories implementing different policies.

<P>The most common policy is to use Repositories as a permanent
storage and distribution medium. As an example, a virtual world
could be distributed on a CD-ROM, and parts of the data in the
world could be kept in a Repository file on the CD-ROM. (The
other main part in a CD-ROM distribution would be a persistent
checkpoint image file).

<P>A variant of this is to use <A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>
as download units
for medium-size packages of data such as realms created by
third parties. A user could download a
<A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFile</A> over the
web and by simply placing it into the appropriate directory the
data in it would become available to a Repository that manages
import of such modules to the running system. These files could
be used to distribute patches, to speed up access to entire
turfs, and (later) to add new functionality to the system.

<P>Yet another variation is to use a Repository to implement a
network cache, storing downloaded objects in case they are
needed again. These caches are pruned on an Least-Recently-Used
basis by discarding old repositoryfiles, after all recently
referenced objects have been copied to later-generation
repositoryfiles. This is (or will be) implemented in
<A HREF="#RepositoryFile">CacheRepository</A>.

<P>A running system could thus have several different
repositories, each implementing one of these roles. It is
necessary to keep these as separate Repositories since the
policies don't mix.

<P>Each Repository has one or more <A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>
associated with it.  These <A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>
form a searchpath.  Only the first
<A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFile</A> can be (but need not be) opened
for write
acccess.

<P>A record in a repository will override the records in
Repositories behind it. As a special case, a record with a
valid key but a zero-length value will pretend to be
"nonexistent", possibly overriding real values in
<A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A> behind it. This is necessary
since there would
otherwise be no way to delete values found in files late in the
<A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFile</A> chain.

<P>Two common patterns receive extra support: Opening all files in
a directory as a single repository, sorting them by filename -
This is used to collect add-on feature, patch, and speedup
files; and opening all files in a directory by filename, adding
one writable file with a name "beyond" the last-sorting such
filename. This is used to support cache directories - look for
this in <A HREF="#RepositoryFile">CacheRepository</A>.

<P>All rights to a repository are defined to be equal to the
rights you have to the repository directory itself and the
files therein and (if applicable) to the explicitly specified
firstFile.

<A name="StandardRepository"></A>
<H4>StandardRepository (Class)</H4>

Implements <A HREF="#SimpleRepository">SimpleRepository</A>.

<P>The StandardRepository is the most commonly used in-vat capability
to the <A HREF="#SuperRepository">SuperRepository</A>, the main Repository
access Policy Object, a
STEWARD. The StandardRepository differs from the
<A HREF="#SuperRepository">SuperRepository</A> in
several important ways:

<ul>
<li>StandardRepository is self-repairing after a quake.
<li>StandardRepository is Read-Only.
<li>StandardRepository does not allow the use of parimeter tables
</ul>

The StandardRepository is supposed to only contain immutable
objects that convey no capabilities. To write to a
<A HREF="#SuperRepository">SuperRepository's</A> (potentially) writable
parts, the
<A HREF="#PublishRepository">PublishRepository</A> and the Internet cache in
<A HREF="#CacheRepository">CacheRepository</A> (not
yet implemented), you will need a different capability.

<P>You can give the StandardRepository as a capability to all in-vat
objects without security implications.

<P>If you need a Repository to contain capability-giving objects or if
you want a Repository you can write to at runtime, then you should
open a regular but distinct Repository for your own purposes - Do
not attempt to use the StandardRepository.

<P>Once you have a StandardRepository capability it's good forever. It
will work just as fine after a quake, since it's self-repairing.

<A name="StandardRepositoryMaker"></A>
<H4>StandardRepositoryMaker (Class)</H4>

The StandardRepositoryMaker is a MagicPowerMaker for creating
<A HREF="#StandardRepository">StandardRepositories</A>.

<A name="PublishRepository"></A>
<H4>PublishRepository (Class)</H4>

The PublishRepository is an in-vat capability to the
<A HREF="#SuperRepository">SuperRepository</A>, the main Repository access
Policy Object, a
STEWARD. The PublishRepository has the following features:

<ul>
<li>PublishRepository is self-repairing after a quake.
<li>PublishRepository is writeable - it implements putHash()
<li>PublishRepository can generate instantly published DataHolders.
</ul>

<P>Once you have a PublishRepository capability it's good forever. It
will work just as fine after a quake, since it's self-repairing.

<P>The PublishRepository may not point to the same
<A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFile</A>
between successive invocations of putHash() or put(). You should
not care.

<P>Items added to the PublishRepository are immediately accesible from
the regular <A HREF="#StandardRepository">StandardRepository</A> and/or
<A HREF="#ParimetereizedRepository">ParimetereizedRepository</A>. The
added object is also published using the
<A HREF="#RepositoryPublisher">RepositoryPublisher</A>, which
means that DataHolders returned from makeDataHolder() can be given
to objects in other vats and immediately work.

<A name="PublishRepositoryMaker"></A>
<H4>PublishRepositoryMaker (Class)</H4>

The PublishRepositoryMaker is a MagicPowerMaker for creating
<A HREF="#PublishRepository">PublishRepositories</A>.

<A name="RepositoryPublisher"></A>
<H4>RepositoryPublisher (Class)</H4>

The RepositoryPublisher is an object used by other
processes/machines to access the
<A HREF="#PublishRepository">PublishRepository</A> in this
process/machine. We publish a SturdyRef to ourselves and place that
SturdyRef in the hints vector of all objecst we publish, which
allows users of these objects to request the actual data from us
and then cache the data locally in their own machines.

<P>Once you have a RepositoryPublisher capability it's good
forever. It is self-healing after quakes.

<P>Noone in a vat should normally need this capability for anything.
We place it in the vat just to make it persistent since entities in
other vats will have a sturdyref to it.


<A name="RepositoryPublisherMaker"></A>
<H4>RepositoryPublisherMaker (Class)</H4>

The RepositoryPublisherMaker is a MagicPowerMaker for creating
<A HREF="#RepositoryPublisher">RepositoryPublishers</A>.

<A name="ERepositoryPublisher"></A>
<H4>ERepositoryPublisher (Eclass)</H4>

A companion class to <A HREF="#RepositoryPublisher">RepositoryPublisher</A>.
This E object receives the getBytes() E messages and asks the
<A HREF="#RepositoryPublisher">RepositoryPublisher</A> for the
data and then returns data or exception to the requestor using the
channel that accompanies the request.

The ERepositoryPublisher (there is only one in each vat) is a GUEST
and stays around forever. The <A HREF="#RepositoryPublisher">RepositoryPublisher</A>
that services <I><B>our</B></I> repository requests is self-healing after a
quake so we don't have to worry about it.

<A name="SuperRepository"></A>
<H4>SuperRepository (Class)</H4>

Implements <A HREF="#SimpleRepository">SimpleRepository</A>.

<P>The SuperRepository is a kind of umbrella Repository that
aggregates several other Repositories with different
characterisitics and uses and Implements a SuperRepository policy,
to be used globally as a fundamental service to anyone in or out of
vat.

<P>We keep one extras Repository, one release/distribution Repository,
one Publish repository, one Cache repository, and one CDROM
repository and search these in some order (see below for
details). A separate Repository named Cert manages certificates and
is accessed through a separate API. The policy dictates default
names for most of these (ECHome/Extras, ECHome/Dist,
ECHome/Publish, ECHome/Cache and ECHome/Cert) but you can override
these names by using environment variables named Extras, Dist,
Publish, and Cache. The CDROM repository does not have a default
directory - there can only be one Repository file there (in fact,
the CDROM symbol has a value that is a file, not a directory), it
is read-only, and it is assumed to be slower than the other
Repositories. It is consulted last, i.e. symbols in it will be
overridden by symbols anywhere else. <p>

<P>Note that you <I><B>must</B></I> define ECHome (preferred value: "ECHome") to
get a SuperRepository at all. This is to allow test programs to
start without complaints if they don't need a Repository. <p>

<P>The Cert repository contains Certificates only and has its own
API. It is not included in the regular search mechanism.  The Cert
Repository uses ECHome/Cert directory and can be redirected using
the Cert environment variable. <p>

<P>The SuperRepository constructor gets called every time the system
is started, like at system startup time or when reviving from a
checkpoint. The SuperRepository is made globally available to CREW
classes through the class CrewRepository and its get() method.<p>

<P>The SuperRepository (in CREW) can be accessed from the Vat using
several different classes that provide different access
capabilities:

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#StandardRepository">StandardRepository</A> provides read-only access and no
parimeterization.
<li><A HREF="#ParimeterizedRepository">ParimeterizedRepository</A> provides read-only access with
parimeterization. ParimeterRepository is normally hidden from vat
denizens by being encapsulated in Fulfillers which are accessed
only in controlled ways from DataHolders. Therefore the
parimeterization functionality is not given out freely to vat
denizens.
<li><A HREF="#PublishRepository">PublishRepository</A> allows the capability holder to
publish any object to anywone who needs it.
<li><A HREF="#CacheRepository">CacheRepository</A> is the capability to add an object to
the local Cache. This is not currently given out to vat denizens -
it is just held by the network downloading code to store downloaded
results in the local cache.
</ul>

<P>Anything that gets published or stored in the cache will
immediatley become part of the regular Repository key lookup so
anything that is added to one of these can immediately be retrieved
using the various SuperRepository get() methods.

<P>If you need a Repository to contain capability-giving objects or if
you want a Repository you can write to at runtime (besides the
<A HREF="#PublishRepository">PublishRepository</A>), then you should open a
regular but distinct
Repository for your own purposes - Do not attempt to use the
SuperRepository. To open a Repository you need write access to a
file or directory to put the Repository in, but that's all you need.

<P>The search order for the SuperRepository is not cast in concrete
but the following seems to work as well as anything else:
<UL>
<LI>First we search Extras so patches (if we ever provide any) and
speedups (if user has downloaded any) always get used. These are
all under user control.
<LI>Next we search the distribution disk. This
means that everything that's normally in the distribution cannot be
overridden by anything except Extras.
<LI>Then we search Publish
because this is still under user control and should yield the same
result on two machines in a publish-import relationship.
<LI>Then we
search CDROM, since it's the slowest if we actually have to get the data, 
and finally we search the Cache.
</UL>

<P>The philosophy is that nothing that is provided as part of the
system in Dist can be overridden, and that the same objects should
be found by a publishing and an importing party. Also, the Cache
has to be searched last so that entries in the Cache that duplicate
entries elsewhere (i.e. on the CD-ROM) won't get stuck in the
Cache.

<A name="RepositoryHandle"></A>
<H4>RepositoryHandle (Class)</H4>

RepositoryHandle instances are used in repository key
SimTables. They contain the  <A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFile</A>
object associated with the file that contains the data, and the file
position in that file.

<A name="RepositoryHandleRecipe"></A>
<H4>RepositoryHandleRecipe (Class)</H4>

Extends Recipe.

A RepositoryHandleRecipe is used for making Recipes for
<A HREF="#RepositoryHandle">RepositoryHandles</A>.

<A name="ParimeterizedRepository"></A>
<H4>ParimeterizedRepository (Class)</H4>

Extends <A HREF="#StandardRepository">StandardRepository</A>.

<P>The ParimeterizedRepository is a variation of the
<A HREF="#StandardRepository">StandardRepository</A> that implements
additional methods to decode
objects using parimeters (perimeter object parameter tables).
In contrast to SuperRepository,

<ul>
<li>ParimeterizedRepository is self-repairing after a quake.
<li>ParimeterizedRepository is Read-Only.
<li>ParimeterizedRepository supports access to the
<A HREF="#CertificateRepository">CertificateRepository</A>.
<li>ParimeterizedRepository supports downloading of data over the network.
</ul>

<P>ParimeterizedRepository is intended to be used mostly inside of
Fulfillers to allow DataHolders to contain parimeterized data
without leaking the parameter objects to the rest of the vat.

<P>Once you have a ParimeterizedRepository capability it's good
forever. It will work just as fine after a quake, since it's
self-repairing.

<A name="CertificateRepository"></A>
<H4>CertificateRepository</H4>

This is (<I>I believe--Karl</I>) just a Repository in which you store
Certificates rather than bytes of data.

<A name="ParimeterizedRepositoryMaker"></A>
<H4>ParimeterizedRepositoryMaker (Class)</H4>

The ParimeterizedRepositoryMaker is a MagicPowerMaker for creating
<A HREF="#ParimeterizedRepository">ParimeterizedRepositories</A>.

<A name="RuntimeExtensibleRepository"></A>
<H4>RuntimeExtensibleRepository (Class)</H4>

Extends <A HREF="#Repository">Repository</A>.

<P>This is an intermediate class that contains functionality used
by both <A HREF="#PublishRepository">PublishRepository</A> and
<A HREF="#CacheRepository">CacheRepository</A>.

<A name="CacheRepository"></A>
<H4>CacheRepository (Class)</H4>

<P>A variation using a <A HREF="#RuntimeExtensibleRepository">RuntimeExtensibleRepository</A> to implement a
network cache, storing downloaded objects in case they are
needed again. These caches are pruned on an Least-Recently-Used
basis by discarding old <A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>, after
all recently referenced objects have been copied to later-generation
<A HREF="#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>.

<A name="RtEncodingParameters"></A>
<H4>RtEncodingParameters (Class)</H4>

An RtEncodingParameters object is a collection of Objects (as keys) and
token objects (typically Strings) as values. Encode() and
repository.put() accept these as an extra argument and when they encode
objects, any object that can be found in the parameters collection gets
replaced by its corresponding token, effectively pruning the object
graph at that point.

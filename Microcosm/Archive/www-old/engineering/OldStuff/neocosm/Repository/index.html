<H2>Introduction</H2>

[98/07/08 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>] The Repository was conceived of as an object which would hold data of
various kinds and allow retrieval of said data through the use of a key.
Over time the set of data types has grown to include such diverse
elements as: bit maps, appearance files, sound files, possibly
code and/or class files, and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope.
The key became standardized as a CryptoHash of the data.

<P>Repositories needed to be read-only in some cases.  Some needed to be
writeable.  There needed to be different Repositories for data from different
sources or with different purviews (cached data, local data, published data,
distribution data).  The art production line needed to deal with file names
and strings rather than CryptoHashes.  The raw data in a Repository needed
to be certifiable with EC Certificates.  If a Repository was asked for data
with a CryptoHash it didn't contain, it needed to know how to look elsewhere
for the data; this led to the evolution of hints, or strings which gave a clue
as to where to look, usually in the form or URLs or partial URLs (whatever
that means).  It became incumbent on Repositories to be able download data
from "The Net".

<P>[98/06/22 <A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A>] The current data repository has many problems, both in implementation
and interface. The purpose of this document is to capture a simpler, layered
architecture for managing the resources in the data repository that meets
the needs of its clients (runtime and production).

<H3>Repository Manager Requirements from <A HREF="mailto:jeff@communities.com">Jeff</A> (98/06/24)</H3>

<OL>
<li>Serves up art/sound/geometry/code.
<li>Not necessarily realm specific -- eg a "turf" user could publish her art in
a repository server and other's would fetch it from the repository server
instead of the user's machine.
<li>Policies determine if who can Add/Remove resource to the repository service.
For example, if you are a "member" of a community, then you can add, say,
10meg
to the community repository server.
<li>Potentially, a repository service is integrated with the certification
service.
If CAs are certifying art/sound/geometry/code, then the certs need to also
be in the repository.  _and_ the CA needs to be able to revoke certs.  Since
certifying and serving up resources are somewhat coupled, it may make
sense for the CA to also host the repository service.

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<H4><a name="PAO">Proposed Architecture Overview</A></H4>

<P>[<A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A>] The services provided by the new repository are a superset of the previous
version, but they are layered into smaller, more manageable and general
components.
</P>
<P>[<A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>:98/06/25] Our
original version of the data repository conflated everything into the
Repository itself--Multiple directories of repository files, caching
schemes, etc. I am proposing (as advised by several people) to split the
problem space up into separate components: Repository, RepositoryFile,
RepositoryManager and RepositoryProducer.
</P>
<ul>

<li>interface <A HREF="Repository.html#WriteableRepository">WriteableRepository</A>

</ul>

A Repository at the interface level will be a single source of data
(RandomAccessFile, SQL database, TCP/IP socket to a remote source,
whatever), from which the user can access data via a CryptoHash key.
The writeable version will allow input of data and return the CryptoHash       
for it.
</P>
<P>A RepositoryFile is an implementation of the Repository which sits
(at this point) on top of a RandomAccessFile of data, reading it into
Hashtables at construction time.  The writeable version will store new
information into separate Hashtables and write out only the new stuff
on command rather than writing out everything; if you don't add anything
to such a repository, no re-writing of the file needs to be done; if you
add only a few things, updating the file is a quick operation.
</P>
<P>The RepositoryManager picks up all of the meta-tasks such as organizing
multiple Repositories (files, caches, network sources) and dealing with
cacheing recently looked up data with options to reread the original source
instead of using a cached version.  It will also handle streaming from one
Repository to another for large sets of data, and it will allow manipulation
of the protocol governing how things are looked up--Either from local caches
or files first, or from the network first, or whatever other schemes we may
come up with.
</P>
<P>A RepositoryProducer is to be used for building repositories offline,
and will deal in String names for the data and correlate said names to
CryptoHashes internally so that the user never has to know about such things.
This is the tool of choice for a production group dealing with
putting together a Repository for a new catalog of art and animation--Basically
a tool for build Repositories from scratch offline rather than tweaking a
Repository while running an application such as HabiSplat.

<P>Some of the new functions in the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java.lang.ClassLoader.html">1.2

<I><a name="DI980625">The</A> current design
doesn't deal with some of Tony's wishes about adding extra information and
generating reports.  This could be added later, but would result in changes
going all the way up to the Repository interface, not just twiddling with
the RepositoryFile's RandomAccessFile format. </I>-- resolved <B>[98/06/30]</B> by

I am presuming that the primary resource type will be data stored in the
repository and that the CryptoHash method of lookup is sufficient. In the
current system, the only place that the name-to-CryptoHash translation
is done is during realm-text parsing. For the production case, where we
want filename lookup to succeed, initially I am ignoring caching completely,
since it is a debug mode feature. If we end up with a generalized caching
mechanism that will support caching the filename case easily, then we should
use it, but I am unwilling to state it as a requirement given the scope
of work we still have to do.
<LI>[<I>98/06/18 <A HREF="mailto:frantz@communities.com">Bill</A></I>] I get the impression that alpha testers are hacking
their realm text files. If this is an important part of the user experience,
then we will probably need to deliver the name to CryptoHash binding in
the customer system. We could also deliver it as an extra cost item depending
on product development's requirements.
<LI>[<I>98/07/01 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>]
Merge Tony's and Bill's separate documents into the requirements section of
this one; then split out the requirements into the specific subdocuments.

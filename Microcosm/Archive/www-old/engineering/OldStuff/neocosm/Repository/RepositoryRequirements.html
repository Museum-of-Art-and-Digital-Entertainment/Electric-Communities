<P>
This is a quick dump of an e-mail thread about things we'll want 
from the new repository.
<BR>
[Note, I've used both 'repository' and 'resource manager' interchangeably here...]
<HR>
<H3><a name="StringNameSupport">CryptoHash support</a></H3>
Presumably, we still want objects inside of ECHabitats to refer to each other via 
unique CryptoHashes. Whether this is true or not really isn't my forte, so I'll 
presume it's still desirable, and if somebody knows better, just squawk.

<H4>[RobJ 27 May 1998]</H4> It definitely simplifies our entire downloading story a lot, since it gives
a piece of art a "name" that is calculated from the art bits themselves;
you then never need to worry about mis-namings resulting in redundant art
or other resources.
<P>
(The old repository was horribly broken in that it calculated the
cryptohashes from not just the names but also from the *network locations*
from where the art originated.  This was unimaginably wrong and would have
been caught had there been _any_ formally reviewed design doc.  We won't be
making _those_ sorts of mistakes again!)

<HR>
<H3><a name="StringNameSupport">String name support</a></H3>
I can see at least three reasons for hanging on to the original string filenames 
of objects in the resource manager. The first would be a function that would turn 
a working resource file back into a hierarchy of files and folders. Unzip, if you will... 
<BR>
The second reason provides for a certain form of versioning. Say I've got a bitmap 
already in the repository. Any catalog or realm text or geometry files point to that 
bitmap via its cryptoHash. If I change a few pixels and dump the bitmap back into the 
repository, it has a new cryptoHash and knows nothing about the other objects that 
used to point to its old self. I'd like the resource manager to be able to first notice 
that I'm inputting a bitmap with a filename that already exists and then offer to 
(or automatically) find all references to the old bitmap and change them to the new 
bitmap. The lack of this kind of functionality is what makes today's repository so 
painful to work with for production purposes.
<BR>
The third reason is simply for organizational purposes. It makes it possible to display 
the contents of a repository in a human-readable format-- most likely an emulation of a 
simple file system.
<BR>
Note that many of the reasons (or at least the ones I care about!) for maintaining 
string support have to do with production. I can imagine a tool that would strip 
the string names out of a repository for a leaner, meaner data file.
<HR>
<H3><a name="CertificateSupport">Certificate support</a></H3>
The repository should be able to hold certificates for its objects. The process 
of generating and using the certificates should be separate.




<HR>
<H3><a name="RuntimeSupport">Runtime support & caching</a></H3>
[Claire] We need a resource manager which takes over the caching functions of
textures found in the dynamics engine and genarilizes this for other data
types.  I have a cache which is meant to handle ui types, harry has one
which handles textures and on and on.  This all belongs in a better thought
out resource manager.  We should be able to support the kind of caching and
cache management of a browser.  If not immediately than evenutally.

<HR>
<H3><a name="SeparateResourceManager">Separate Resource Manager from Repository</a></H3>
[Claire] To that end, I'd like to see us break out the Resource Manager which is
concerned with getting data into, out of  a Resource Repository and the the
Resource Repository which is involved with storing resources.  I think
these should be seperate milestones with documentation which details the
functionality of each.

<HR>
<H3><a name="TrackExtraInfo">Track extra info about objects</a></H3>
Again, this could be stripped out for shipping version, but it would be great 
to track author, object type (bitmap, vrml, catalog, realmText, certificate, 
etc...), date submitted, size, etc... 

<HR>
<H3><a name="Reporting">Reporting</a></H3>
If we store the information described above, we can query vital statistics about 
our repository: Show me the VRML files over 100k? How many bitmaps aren't referenced 
by any other objects?

<HR>
<H3><a name="Speedy">Speedy</a></H3>
Don't make production people wait to make simple changes. This probably means 
supporting things like appending changes to the end of the file, and marking 
objects to be deleted. We could then provide a utility for compacting the 
repository when necessary.

<HR>
<H3><a name="FileSupport">File support</a></H3>
I'll still maintain that the fastest way for production people to work is via file 
support. Keep a text file open in your editor. Change a line and launch Cosm. 
It would be nice if there were at least a production version of the resource manager 
that could get objects from files if they're available.

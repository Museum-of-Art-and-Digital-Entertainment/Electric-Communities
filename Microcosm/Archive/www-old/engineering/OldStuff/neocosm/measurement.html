<H1><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Measurement Requirements for Neocosm</FONT></B></H1>

<P>Created 7/1/98 by Bill </P>

<P>The following is a list of performance measurements we would like to
be able to make in Neocosm. It is based on our experiences with R167.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Garbage collection rate. Garbage collects can be counted by a garbage
object with a finalizer method which adds one to a counter and then creates
another instance of the garbage object.</LI>

<LI>Paging rates</LI>

<LI>E Run queue length</LI>

<LI>E Run queue latency - (How long between queuing a message and it's
dispatch.)</LI>

<LI>E message processing time - (How long it takes to process a message.)</LI>

<LI>N longest executing messages, with some detail about what objects,
methods, and parameters are involved.</LI>

<LI>Synchronization delay for Comm thread to vat communication.</LI>

<LI>Bytes send/received over each comm connection, and total rate for the
vat</LI>

<LI>Connection creation/shutdown rate.</LI>
</UL>

<P>We also need a coherent way of recording these measurements for analysis.</P>

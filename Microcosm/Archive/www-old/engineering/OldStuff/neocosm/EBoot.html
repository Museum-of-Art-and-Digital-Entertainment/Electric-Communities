<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>
This document is an attempt to explain the E program startup process
in general and the startup of Microcosm in particular.<BR>

<H2>Requirements </H2>

<P>
The procedure for starting up an E application has to solve two
problems. First, it needs to get the E execution environment and
run queue set up prior to actually launching into the application
per se, thus it needs to insinuate itself in between the usual
Java program launch interface and the application. Second, it
needs to establish the initial set of capabilities and package
them in a way suitable for being passed as parameters to the highest
level of the application, thus it needs to be in cahoots with
the whole mechanism for handling the E capability environment.
<BR>

<H2>Architecture and Non-architecture</H2>

<H4>EBoot, In Theory </H4>

<P>
A Java program is started up by giving the Java interpreter the
name of a startup class. The interpreter looks for a static main()
method in this class and calls it, passing it a single argument
consisting of the command line arguments stuffed into an array
of strings. The startup of an E program is similar, except that
the startup class implements the einterface ELaunchable, which
declares a single method:
<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=2>public einterface ELaunchable {
    emethod go(EEnvironment env);
}</FONT>
</PRE>

<P>
The go() emethod is passed the initial E execution environment
(which includes, among other things, the command line arguments).
Note that whereas in the case of starting a Java program the initial
step is a call to a static method on the startup class, in E the
initial go() message is sent to an instance of the startup class
which the startup process creates.
<P>
We get from the Java startup process to the E startup process
via the Java class ec.e.boot.EBoot. This class provides a one-size-fits-all
Java main() method that invokes the E startup procedure. The first
Java command line argument to EBoot is the name of the E startup
eclass, with additional command line parameters then following
on in the traditional fashion. EBoot in turn creates an instance
of the specified E startup class and sends it the go() message
along with the initial E execution environment which EBoot also
creates.
<H4>EBoot, In Reality </H4>

<P>
The above simple and straightforward story represents the original
architectural intent. Naturally, the real story of what actually
happens is way more complicated. EBoot.main() actually just calls
the static method callEMain() on the class ec.util.EThreadGroup,
passing its own class name (i.e., the string &quot;ec.e.boot.EBoot&quot;)
and the command line arguments array. EThreadGroup.callEMain()
in turn creates new instances of EThreadGroup (a subclass of Java's
ThreadGroup class) and ec.util.EMainThread (a subclass of Java's
Thread class). The EMainThread object constructor takes three
arguments: the newly created EThreadGroup (which it passes to
its super constructor), the name of the E boot class that was
passed to the EThreadGroup constructor, and the command line args
array. It uses CRAPI to extract a Method object for the method
EMain() from the named E boot class. EThreadGroup.callEMain()
then launches the EMainThread thread in the standard Java manner
by calling its start() method. The start() method calls EMainThread.run()
which then uses CRAPI to invoke the remembered EMain() Method,
passing it the remembered args array. The EBoot.EMain() method
then does the actual work of initializing the E environment, instantiating
the E startup object, and sending the go() message to it.
<P>
All of this indirection and fiddling around with CRAPI is so that
(1) the E run queue gets launched as its own special thread in
its own special thread group, and (2) there can be a choice of
the actual boot class. In addition to EBoot, there are several
alternative boot classes, including ec.e.boot.ELogin, e.quake.Revive,
and ec.ifc.app.IFCBoot. These all end up doing essentially the
same job as EBoot, except under different startup circumstances:
<UL>
<LI>EBoot -- vanilla E computation startup
<LI>ELogin -- startup for Microcosm, does a bunch of extra initialization
work
<LI>IFCBoot -- starts up IFC and then uses EBoot to actually start
E computation
<LI>Revive -- startup from checkpoint
</UL>

<P>
The actual work associated with starting up is done in the EMain()
method. In the case of EBoot it:
<UL>
<LI>Builds a Java Properties table, including parsing any property
setting arguments from the command line (and this parsing removes
these from the args array that the application will eventually
see).
<LI>Creates an instance of the startup class and verifies that
it is indeed an ELaunchable.
<LI>Creates a new Vat for the E computation to take place in.
<LI>Creates and initializes a new EEnvironment object, giving
it the args array, the Properties table, the Vat, and a reference
to the system class loader.
<LI>Initializes timers, clocks, entropy collection, the tracing
package (if enabled), the Inspector (if enabled), the initial
set of crew capabilities, and the EStdio class.
<LI>Sends the go() message to the startup object.
</UL>

<P>
The startup object which EMain() invokes is presumed to be fully
trusted. The EEnvironment object which is passed in the go() message
contains all the capabilities needed to be in total command of
the Vat. It is the responsibility of the startup object to hold
these capabilities closely and to start up the less privileged
computation which will actually run the application.
<P>
ELogin does essentially all the same work as EBoot, and then some.
It handles class preloading (if enabled), opening up the crew
Repository, starting up various timers that are used to collect
performance statistics, and invoking the login UI to get a user
name and password. The ELogin code is currently quite a bit more
complicated than EBoot, in part because it has a much larger quantity
of diagnostic and tracing code than EBoot and in part because
it contains a number of performance enhancing tweaks and JVM bug
workarounds. It also contains thread handshaking in support of
the login UI, which, as a handcoded AWT thing, runs asynchronously.
<P>
IFCBoot is really just a startup wrapper rather than an entirely
different boot model. It starts an IFC thread, waits for it to
get going, and then simply calls EBoot.EMain() directly.
<P>
Revive handles the revival of an orthogonally persisted E computation.
It departs from the standard boot model entirely, the Revive class
merely serving to insinuate the restore-from-checkpoint operation
into the standard startup command sequence. Revive.EMain() processes
the command line arguments and properties in the standard fashion,
starts up tracing and entropy collection, then punts to another
static method, Revive.doRevival(). This doRevival() method is
also called by code in ELogin when the latter detects the presence
of a checkpoint file during login (this code is actually commented
out at the moment, as a first step toward removing orthogonal
persistence support from the Microcosm application; however the
scaffolding remains in place). The doRevival() method restores
the Vat from the checkpoint file and sets it to running. No go()
message is sent, of course, since the computation in the checkpoint
is presumed to already be started (else it couldn't have gotten
into the checkpoint in the first place).
<H4>Login </H4>

<P>
<I>Describe login here.</I>
<H4>Microcosm Startup </H4>

<P>
The canonical startup class (that is, the one that receives the
go() message) for our application is ec.pl.runtime.Agency. Nominally
this is the class that starts up the Pluribus runtime, but in
reality it is the class that starts up the Microcosm application
(as a result of various unfortunate historical twists of fate,
these two components have gotten inextricably mixed up with each
other).
<P>
Agency has two startup pathways, because it is both an ELaunchable
and a Seismologist. In the ELaunchable case it starts up via a
go() message from EBoot or equivalent. In the Seismologist case
it starts up via a noticeCommit() message from the Vat. In normal
operation, the go() method and the noticeCommit() method each
simply send the Agency object an initialStartup() message, which
is where the two startup pathways merge. However, the go() method
actually has two startup modes, regulated by the makeTemplate
property. If makeTemplate is false (the normal case) it sends
itself the initialStartup() message. However, if makeTemplate
is true, it immediately checkpoints and then exits, leaving behind
a template checkpoint file. 
<P>
Assuming the normal startup pathway, Agency eventually finds its
way to the initialStartup() method. This method performs some
additional general-purpose initialization steps, principally filling
out the AgentInfo struct which the Agency object holds onto: 
it summons the directory root maker and the UI framework maker
magic powers, creates an UnumMaster object, and establishes a
Registrar. It then looks for the Agent property and uses this
as the name of an Agent class which it creates and sends a go()
message of its own (the Agent go() message takes two parameters,
the EEnvironemnt and the AgentInfo).
<P>
Although the choice of Agent class is parameterized via a property
setting, there is actually only one class which implements the
Agent interface. This is ec.cosm.objects.agent.MicrocosmText.
The MicrocosmText.go() method does some initialization of its
own: it does some state bundle loading, inits the Repository,
hub event log and member database, does a bunch of fiddling with
timers and tracing, then falls into MicrocosmText.initRealm().
This in turn extracts the name of a realmText file from the property
RealmTextFile and calls MicrocosmText.createRealm() with this
name as a parameter.  If the soulTest property is true and the
checkpoint property names a checkpoint file, then createRealm
restores a state-bundled-persisted realm from the checkpoint file.
Otherwise, it reads the realmText file and creates a new realm
from scratch as described by the contained realmText.
<H2>Current implementation </H2>

<P>
As there is little architecture per se in this subsystem, the
text above describes the structure of the current implementation
rather than the plan it was supposed to conform to.
<H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover? 
</H4>

<P>
The code implicated in startup spans a fairly large number of
directories:
<P>
ELaunchable and EEnvironment are in ec4/javasrc/ec/e/run
<P>
ELogin and EBoot are in ec4/javasrc/ec/e/boot
<P>
Various other login related classes are in cosm1/ui/gui/login
and its subdirectories
<P>
EMainThread and EThreadGroup are in ec4/javasrc/ec/util
<P>
IFCBoot is in ec4/javasrc/ec/ifc/app
<P>
Revive is in ec4/javasrc/ec/e/quake
<P>
Agency, Agent, AgentInfo and UnumMaster are in ec4/javasrc/ec/pl/runtime
<P>
MicrocosmText and its related support classes are in cosm1/objects/agent
<H4>Is it Javadoc'ed? </H4>

<P>
Not surprisingly, given that this code spans a number of different
packages and classes written and maintained by a large number
of different programmers, the degree of Javadoc'ing varies considerably.
Some of it is thoroughly Javadoc'd, some not at all, and some
has Javadoc comments that are present but out of date. Cleanup
is warranted.
<H2>Design Issues</H2>

<H4>Open Issues </H4>

<P>
The current startup code is designed to support a degree of generality
that is not currently exploited. There is some question as to
whether this degree of generality ever will be exploited. In any
case, the startup pathway is extremely long and complicated, with
initialization of various components of the system happening at
a variety of levels in the code.
<P>
The present scheme has three levels of class parameterization:
<OL>
<LI>The boot class
<UL>
<LI>specified via the first command line argument
<LI>controls E runtime startup
<LI>vectored via JVM startup convention: internal class load followed
by static call to main(args)
</UL>

<LI>The startup class
<UL>
<LI>specified via the second command line argument
<LI>controls Agency startup
<LI>vectored via E message send: newInstance() call followed by
send of go(env)
</UL>

<LI>The agent class
<UL>
<LI>specified via the &quot;Agent&quot; property
<LI>controls application startup
<LI>vectored via E message send: newInstance() call followed by
send of go(env,info)
</UL>

</OL>

<P>
However, the choices are much more fixed than this pattern might
suggest. The boot class is really always ELogin or EBoot, the
startup class is always Agency, and the agent class is always
MicrocosmText. Within the space of these fixed choices, however,
are a number of other startup variations controlled by other means:
<P>
ELogin and EBoot have to perform essentially the same sets of
initialization, but they do so with code that is sufficiently
different between the two classes that it is hard to see the points
of commonality. In addition, ELogin runs the account manager to
take the user through the login dialog -- but does so before the
rest of the runtime environment is established and so invokes
some 5000 lines of custom UI code. The boot classes are additionally
complicated by the logic to funnel through a common body of thread
initialization code, which is in turn complicated by having the
boot methods be static (which thus entails fiddling around with
CRAPI).
<P>
Agency supports two different entry paths, depending on whether
it is started from the normal pattern or as a result of checkpoint
recovery. However, we are phasing out orthogonal persistence and
so much of the other code needed for the latter path to work has
already been removed or commented out. Furthermore, in its normal
startup mode, Agency can either startup the program or it can
fork and hibernate -- additional support for orthogonal persistence
that is on its way out.
<P>
MicrocosmText also has two startup paths. Depending on parameter
settings, it will either restore from a state bundle checkpoint
or it will create a new realm from a realmText file. And in any
case having realmText processing be embedded in the system startup
process seems perverse at best.
<P>
A number of other minor initializations are parameterized by property
settings. These conditionally enable or disable various subsystems,
such as the Inspector, tracing, logging, and so forth. We probably
want to retain this sort of control. However, different subsystems
are regulated at different levels in the multi-level model, with
no particular rhyme or reason as to why a particular subsystem
is controlled from a particular place. The same comment applies
to initializations in general. Some systems are initialized in
more than one place, in some cases with complex conditional logic
to make sure the program doesn't step on its own toes (the Repository,
in particular, seems to be initialized in three different places,
but the three sets of initialzations are all very different),
and in other cases have their initialization partially on one
place and partially in another..
<P>
The overall organization of the startup process reflects the organic
history of this code rather than a coherent plan. By rationalizing
some of this and reducing the number of levels of indirection,
it should be possible to reduce the bulk of the code considerably,
and to make it significantly simpler, clearer, and easy to maintain.
A significant refactoring of the startup code is warranted.

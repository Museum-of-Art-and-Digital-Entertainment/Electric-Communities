Reusing capabilities could make subsequent messages gofaster at the cost of making error handling more complex.<P>More care can be taken in development of the KnownAvatarList tofavor the most recently interacted with in name completion.<P>Remove EExceptions and ewhens in favor of explicit messages.<P>The ingredient contains strings which should be internationalized.<P>Q: Is it feasible to integrate Telepathy with some form of ThePalace product?<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4><P>&nbsp;<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4><P>None.<H2>Current implementation</H2><H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4><P>cosm1/objects/ingredients/Telepathy<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4><P>Yes, by Trevor.<H4>Examples</H4><P>na<H4>Testing and Debugging</H4><P>&nbsp;<H4>Uses ewhen and etry</H4><P>Yes.<H2>Design Issues</H2><H4>Resolved Issues</H4><P>It works.

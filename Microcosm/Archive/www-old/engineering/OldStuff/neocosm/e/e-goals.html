<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">E Design Goals</H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(from a correspondence with Amy Marr, archived on ec_design)</P>
<P>E is designed to start as a scripting / rapid prototyping / command language, sacrificing performance and support
for programming in-the-large (like static type checking) in exchange for simplicity and ease of use. Not sacrificed
even a smidgen is security. Like E, E is a capability-secure persistent distributed pure-object language (it inherits
most of these features from our E platform).</P>
<P>As a simple one-at-a-time command language, E is intended to be quickly learnable by non-programmers. As a
programming language, E is intended to seduce lightweight programmers schooled in C-tradition languages: C, C++,
Java, Python, Perl, Tcl, csh. It should also be accessible to (fingers crossed) Visual Basic programmers. Speaking
loosely, Python is to C++ as E is to Old-E.</P>
<P>(And I didn't say &quot;lambda&quot; even once. Oops.)</P>
<H2>Intended Uses at EC:</H2>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Internal poking</B>. The difference between the Smalltalk / Lisp / scripting language experience and the
	Java / Old-E / Pluribus experience is striking. In the former, &quot;what would happen if?&quot; questions are answered
	interactively during that moment of curiosity. This supports learning and debugging. (This difference is often
	thought to be associated with compiled vs interpreted languages, but this is mistaken, as Smalltalk is as fully
	compiled as C, and until recently Java was only interpreted.)
	<P>E can already invoke any public method of any Java object, and can send and receive any public emethod as well.
	Once E is available, I expect most of us will keep a live E read-eval-print loop at our side while programming.</P>
	<P>
	<LI><B>Internal Testing</B>. E should be a good language for writing replayable test scripts. Initially for unit
	testing of internal programming abstractions. Once also made a scripting language for Microcosm, we should be able
	to easily write replayable scripts of user actions. Which brings us to:
	<P>
	<LI><B>A Microcosm Command Language</B>. E's message dispatch mechanism is designed to also include calculated
	verbs, such as appear on our pop-up menus. Once this interfacing is done and scoping issues have been figured out,
	E is intended to replace our current command line interface.
	<P>
	<LI><B>A Secure Hub Administration Language</B>. This was actually the motivating case for creating the language.
	<P>
	<LI><B>User Creation / Extension of Una Behaviors</B>. This could range from simply adding new Una verbs defined
	in terms of existing ones, to piecemeal programming interactions like Hypercard's ability to &quot;dive into&quot;
	a button and edit its script. MOO experiences show this to be a compelling source of richness of the world.  See
	<A HREF="e-world-scripting.html">E World Scripting Examples</A>.
</UL>

<P>&gt;Is this something we will eventually ship?</P>

<P>In stages. Early on, potentially only to hub operators. I expect support for other uses to ship shortly thereafter.
Once we ship, the pressures for open programmability will quickly become irresistible.</P>

<P>Long term, assuming it can eventually be compiled as well as Scheme (as it was designed to be), E could give
us a migration path away from Java. E is sort of Old-E without the Java (which ironically is different from Joule,
even though Old-E is sort of Joule + Java). We have already spent at least ten times as much effort working around
flaws in Java as it takes to invent, build, and support a good simple programming language (like Scheme, Joule,
or E). So much for saving effort by leveraging a supported platform!</P>

<P>Oh yeah,</P>

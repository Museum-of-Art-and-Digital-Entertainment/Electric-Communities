<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Over time, programmers have become (in some ways) reasonably successful at organizing computation that occurs
within a single machine. The necessary lessons cost generations of failed companies. For Electric Communities to
succeed, we must become reasonably successful at organizing computation spread across a large number of machines,
while securely serving the interests of a diverse set of parties. To succeed at this, we cannot afford to learn
the necessary lessons from scratch -- these would likely be even more expensive than the uni-machine lessons. Nor
can we simply leverage the lessons of previous distributed systems builders -- there are not yet adequate demonstrations
of success. Instead, we must borrow lessons from uni-machine programming where appropriate.</P>
<P>But only where appropriate! Distributed systems (such as CORBA and RMI) can also fail by overgeneralization
from uni-machine programming practices. In certain ways, uni-machine and distributed systems are very similar.
In other ways, they are very different. Our strategy for generalizing uni-machine programming paradigms must account
for both their similarities and their differences.

<P>Some current issues with the design of New-E have their own pages explaining the design space and the potential
solutions. <BR>
Currently the only one is the <A HREF="ProxyTyping.html">proxy typing</A> discussion.
<H5>Background reading</H5>
<P>E derives from a long and diverse pedigree of languages and operating systems:

<H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
<P>Currently, ec5/src/javasrc/ec/elib/*. It uses ec5/src/javasrc/ec/{util, util/assertion, trace, tables}. It is
used at least by ec5/src/javasrc/ec/e/*.<A NAME="javadocing"></A></P>
<H4>What Javadoc Does Who Need to Know?</H4>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>Note: the following links point at javadoc generated from ec4, since that is currently the only javadoc-umentation
	of interface (as opposed to implementation) that we have. Once we have interface javadoc-umentation of ec5, I'll
	edit the links accordingly. As of this writing, the ec4 javadocs are not yet too stale to be useful.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>All of ELib is javadoc'ed, but for the ELib user most of this is irrelevant internal detail. The normal ELib
application programmer should only need to use the methods found in <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.E.html">E</A>,
the <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.Promise.html#Promise(java.lang.Class)">constructors</A> and <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.Promise.html#takeResolver()">takeResolver</A>
method of Promise, and the methods found in <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.Resolver.html">Resolver</A>.</P>
<P>Intermediate between ELib implementer and ELib application programmer is the ELib framework creator -- using
the ELib constructs to create new forms of message plumbing. In the E language, the abstraction provided for this
purpose was the Deflector. In ELib, one instead defines new implementors of <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.base.Callable.html">Callable</A>
(for intercepting synchronous calls) or <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.Sendable.html">Sendable</A> (for
intercepting asynchronous and synchronous calls). For example, A <I>Proxy</I> would be a kind of Sendable, since
it needs to intercept asynchronous calls, whereas a vat-to-crew or crew-to-vat <I>Tether</I> may be a Callable,
if it only needs to intercept synchronous calls.</P>
<P>If one wished to create multiple runQ's (need link to issues), one would also need to use the class <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.Runner.html">Runner</A>.
Programs not trying to do this should simply begin with:</P>
<PRE>        Runner.setDefaultRunner(new Runner());</PRE>
<P>
<H4>Examples, Testing and Debugging</H4>
<P>ELib is currently tested by two pieces of code: <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.tests.ERunDemo.html">ERunDemo</A>
is a trivial test/example that demostrates event-loop concurrency and Promise-based optimism. <A HREF="http:index.html">E</A>
is a programming language, usable as a test harness to test/exercise/debug all of ELib as well as programs built
using ELib. (As you might guess from the names, ELib was originally built to be the runtime library for E.)<A NAME="bugs"></A></P>
<H2>Known Bugs &amp; Deficiencies</H2>
<P><I>E.whenKept()</I> and <I>E.whenBroken()</I> are not yet implemented.</P>
<P><A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/ec.ezlib.prim.tests.ERunDemo.html">ERunDemo</A> demonstrates and documents a mysterious
(but repeatable!) concurrency control bug that doesn't occur under the debugger. This is high priority.</P>
<P>The coverage testing hooks in ec.elib.prim.JavaMemberNode provide access to global static state, and so provide
a covert channel. This needs to be guarded by a capability which can be given out only to authorized testing code.</P>
<P>ELib to Java Binding Issues:

<UL>
	<LI>Only arguments are coerced to the parameter type. We should also coerce the receiver to the receiver type.
	(in ec.elib.prim.JavaMemberNode.execute())
	<P>
	<LI>ec.elib.prim.JavaMemberNode.coerce() is a hacky bunch of special cases that grew as needed, rather than a principled
	framework. Such a principled framework has yet to be designed.
	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Deflectors of public java interfaces should eventually be generated and loaded on the fly, driven by attempting
		to load a mangling of the original interface name.
		<P>
	</UL>
	<LI>ec.elib.prim.ScriptMaker currently presents <I>all</I> public java methods and fields of <I>all</I> public
	java classes, modulo 1) In overloading, only name and arity are significant. and 2) A sugaring mechanism whereby
	various sugaring classes (ec.elib.base.*Sugar and ec.elib.prim.ObjectSugar) add or override instance methods of
	the corresponding java classes. Deficiencies in this mechanism:
	<P>
	<UL>
		<LI>When more than one java method of the same name has the same arity, an arbitrary one wins. This is unacceptably
		stupid. Rather, that name-arity should be ruined for that object (bound to a method that throws), and methods with
		each of the full signatures as names should be defined instead. <B><I>Partially done:</I> </B>Methods we also register
		the methods under mangled names using the parameter-type signature.
		<P>
		<LI>I'm not sure whether a non-sugar instance method on a subclass can override a sugar method associated with
		a superclass. This is needed for the ambassador pattern.
		<P>
		<LI>For production use, methods should be exported explicitly, and hidden by default. The exported methods should
		all be audited for security.
		<P>
		<LI>For debugging use, where methods are exported by default (as in the current implementation) one must be able
		to explicitly prevent certain methods from being exported (such as java.lang.Object.wait()).
		<P>
		<LI>The binding between a class and its sugaring class is currently by initialize-time registration in ec.elib.prim.ScriptMaker.
		It should instead be by class discovery of a mangling of the original class's name.
		<P>
		<LI>Inheritance of multiple sugaring (for which there are no known cases) just picks the sugaring of an arbitrary
		supertype, rather than doing the right thing. What &quot;the right thing&quot; is here has yet to be specified.
		<P>
		<LI>There is currently no way to sugar a static method.
		<P>
		<LI>JavaMemberNodes are currently recreated rather than inherited, leading to wasted space, and making the ELib
		coverage recorder much less useful.
		<P>
		<LI>Each array type gets its own vtable with its own JavaMemberNodes, when they should instead be shared, similarly
		wasting space and making coverage stats less meaningful.
		<P>
	</UL>
	<LI>ELib needs a protocol-inquiry meta-protocol so that, for example, an object can be registered as listening
	only for those events it can respond to. (thanks for this requirement go to Tony Grant and Bill Frantz) E would
	also benefit from this addition.
</UL>

<H2>Design Issues</H2>
<H4>Resolved Issues</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Methods are registered under both their unmangled and their mangled names.  See <A HREF="ejbind.html">The E-to-Java
	Binding Spec</A>.
	<LI>If <I>p</I> is a broken reference, should <I>E.resolution(p)</I> throw a NestedException containing the problem,
	or should it return <I>p</I>? Either answer is semantically plausible, so it would be good to know which is more
	convenient. But this needs to get pinned down <I>soon</I>!
	<UL>
		<LI>Done. If <I>p</I> is broken, E.resolution(p) returns p. Turns out to be much more convenient.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">E World Scripting Examples</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">for those in the Visual Basic syntactic tradition</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(from a correspondence with Tony Grant, archived on ec_ez)</P>
<P>This document presents examples in E for scripting behaviors in our virtual worlds. Tony started things off
with examples showing how our worlds might be made easily scriptable for the Visual Basic programmer. After some
(archived) iterations, here is my best take on doing Tony's examples within all our foundational constraints--including
capability secure programming--in the E language. The examples use E as it works today except for two enhancements
noted below.</P>
<P><A HREF="vb-oid-scripting.html">Here</A> is Tony's original message. The examples in this document and Tony's
message are now cross-linked to each other so you can easily see how the examples compare. IMO, the results compare
well with the imagined Visual Basic code. For those more comfortable with the C syntactic tradition (spanning at
least C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Tcl, and csh), <A HREF="e-world-scripting.html">here</A> is a version of this
document you may like better. The E language accepts both styles.</P>
<P>However, I'm almost totally ignorant of Pluribus and of the internals of the cosm level of our system, so the
interface to it presented here may be wholly unrealistic. Cosm/Unum programmers: How reasonable are our assumptions?
How reasonable are our examples?</P>

<P>&gt;1. Launch Microcosm with Yappy as the avatar and have him transition back<BR>
&gt;and forth between CentralPark region and BeachResort.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;This would help us to find any memory leaks occurring on transitions. I<BR>
&gt;don't know how much overhead would be involved in this, but it would be<BR>
&gt;great if it were simple:</P>

<P>&gt;8. The wandering avatar: (no error checking for a region with no portals)<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure what you intended by saying &quot;no error checking&quot;. If you want to code in ignorance of the
issue of errors, uncaught errors will terminate your loop:</P>
<PRE>    TestLaunch(bodies[&quot;Dax&quot;], regions[&quot;CentralPark&quot;])

    For i In (1..100)
        WalkTo(RandomElement(regions))
    End For
</PRE>
<P>The first <TT>WalkTo</TT> that throws an error will exit this loop. Alternatively, if you want to ignore errors
and keep going:</P>
<PRE>    TestLaunch(bodies[&quot;Dax&quot;], regions[&quot;CentralPark&quot;])

    For i In (1..100)
        Try
            WalkTo(RandomElement(regions))
        Catch
        End Try
    End For
</PRE>
<P><TT>try/catch</TT> is how you handle errors. The empty curlies after the '<TT>catch</TT>' say to do nothing
on an error.</P>

<H2>Assumed E Enhancements</H2>
<P>E has already reserved the &quot;<TT>On</TT>&quot; keyword. This document assumes that the &quot;<TT>On</TT>&quot;
keyword has been added to the language in a role similar to the existing &quot;<TT>To</TT>&quot; keyword. The difference
between &quot;<TT>On</TT>&quot; and &quot;<TT>To</TT>&quot; reflect two very different purposes for invocation
(calling/sending) in object oriented programming.</P>

<UL>
	<LI>When object A invokes object B, usually it is to serve a purpose of A's, and the invocation can be seen as
	an imperative or query. The invocation is assumed to be on the <I>caller's behalf</I>. For this case the &quot;<TT>To</TT>&quot;
	form is used to define the corresponding method, as in &quot;<TT>To verb(arg, ...)</TT>&quot;, and invocation can
	be either a synchronous call or an asynchronous send (&quot;<TT>&lt;-</TT>&quot;). A synchronous call is a sensible
	possibility since A is subcontracting to B, and B's effects are typically part of the effects A is trying to bring
	about. Since the invocation is assumed to be on A's behalf, a to-invocation has an implicit return value, which
	is a Promise in the asynchronous case.
	<P>
	<LI>The other common purpose for an invocation is event notification (called by various o-o commentators <I>Observers,
	Dependents, Reactors, ...</I>). Typically, object B will have earlier registered with A an interest in certain
	kinds of events. Later, when A decides that these events have occurred, it informs all interested parties, like
	B, by invoking them. These invocations are assumed to be on the <I>callee's behalf</I>. The method would be defined
	as &quot;<TT>On eventName(arg, ...)</TT>&quot;, and the corresponding invocation could only be asynchronous (&quot;<TT>&lt;-</TT>&quot;),
	since B's reactions to the event (and any consequent side effects) are not properly part of the action A was in
	the midst of. By the same token, A is assumed not to be interested in any results or exceptions from B, so no implicit
	return value is supplied.
</UL>

<P>As Hypercard has shown, the event driven model is quite pleasant. Unlike Smalltalk, Hypercard does not make
an object register in order to receive notifications of events it's interested in. It suffices to have (the equivalent
of) an <TT>on</TT>-method for that event, and to be in a context in which these events are <I>ambient</I>. For
our worlds, the Frame/Session (or maybe the container?) can serve as such a context. [Need to explain <I>group
membership</I>] We therefore need a CRAPI-like E meta-protocol so such a context can find out, when an object
is added to that context, what <TT>on</TT>-methods it has. An object can be <I>assumed</I> to be interested in
any event it has an <TT>On</TT>-method for.

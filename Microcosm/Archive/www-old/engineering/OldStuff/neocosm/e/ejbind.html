<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The E-to-Java Binding Spec</H1>
<P><I>This is not yet a spec, just a note on a recent change.</I></P>

<P>ELib's invocation mechanism only takes message name and argument arity as<BR>
significant. Mapping this to pre-existing java code is problematic, as<BR>
java allows overloading on type. (Of course, there's no problem for new<BR>
code written to overload only on arity.) One can now invoke such java<BR>
methods by using a message name that includes the parameter types. For<BR>
example, given<BR>
<BR>
Object[] args = { new File(&quot;/foo.txt&quot;) };<BR>
Object maker = new EStaticWrapper(FileWriter.class);<BR>
<BR>
Btw, EStaticWrapper wraps a class so that its public static methods and<BR>
constructors are available to ELib. As seen by ELib, constructors are<BR>
methods named &quot;new&quot;, so the following<BR>
<BR>
FileWriter fw = (FileWriter)E.call(maker, &quot;new&quot;, args);<BR>
<BR>
or in E<BR>
<BR>
define fw := java.io.FileWriter new file:/foo.txt<BR>
<BR>
should invoke the FileWriter(File) constructor. Unfortunately, there are<BR>
other public one-arg constructors, so ELib doesn't know which to choose.<BR>
With this checkin, the following works:<BR>
<BR>
FileWriter fw = (FileWriter)E.call(maker, &quot;new(File)&quot;, args);<BR>
<BR>
or in E<BR>
<BR>
fw := java.io.FileWriter call(&quot;new(File)&quot;, [ file:/foo.txt ])<BR>
<BR>
A mangled message names is an interned string consisting of<BR>
1) regular message name<BR>
2) open paren<BR>
3) list of types, separated by &quot;, &quot; (comma, space)<BR>
4) close paren.<BR>
<BR>
Each type is<BR>
a) if a scalar, the scalar type name. e.g., char -&gt; &quot;char&quot;.<BR>
b) if an array, the base type followed by &quot;[]&quot;.<BR>
c) otherwise, the last segment of the fully qualified class name.<BR>
eg, java.io.File -&gt; &quot;File&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
We use only the last segment of a fully qualified name because I) this<BR>
feature is intended only as a convenience, II) it corresponds more closely<BR>
to how java code is written (even if it corresponds less closely to what<BR>
the java code means), III) and I have never seen two overloads of one<BR>
method name distinguished only on the package of the named types. If<BR>
anyone has a reason why we need to support that case, please let me know.

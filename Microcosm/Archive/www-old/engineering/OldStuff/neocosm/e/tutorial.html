<H1>E Tutorial</H1>
<P>Adapted by MarkM from a document by Amy Mar.
<H2>Starting E</H2>
<P>The shell command &quot;e&quot; can be used to start an interactive E command-line session, or to execute E
programs stored in files. To run &quot;e&quot;, you currently need our standard build environment, and to have
built in ec4 at least the following directories:</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>src/ec4/javasrc/ec/util<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/util/assertion<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/trace<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/tables<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/elib/quasi<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/elib/base<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/elib/prim<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/e/scope<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/e/evm<BR>
	src/ec4/javasrc/ec/e/syntax</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Given our standard build environment, a</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>$ cd /src<BR>
	$ make everything</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Should accomplish this. Alternatively, E can be built in Semantic Cafe (<A HREF="../../neocosm/idefiles/RunningEMainInCafe.html">here's
how</A>), but someone (Bob? Karl?) would have to figure out how to make the result callable from the command line.</P>
<P>To start E, merely type &quot;e&quot; at the shell prompt:</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>$ e<BR>
	?</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>Note, in bash under Windows95, you may see two question marks instead of one. Don't worry about it.</I></P>
<P>The question mark is E's prompt. If you type in an E expression, it'll get evaluated, and the resulting value
printed out:</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>? 2 + 3<BR>
	# value: 5

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Alternatively, if you invoke &quot;e&quot; with a command line argument, it will assume this is the name of
a file containing an E program. For example, if we put</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>println(2 + 3)</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>into a file named &quot;add-test.e&quot;, then, going back to our command shell, we can run this program:</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>$ e add-test.e<BR>
	5</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You need to surround the &quot;2 + 3&quot; with the &quot;println&quot; in this case since E does not print
results by default when interpreting a file.</P>
<P><I>Note: You may also be getting a bunch of tracing spam when E starts up. To suppress this, use &quot;</I><TT>TraceLog_name=foo.log</TT>&quot;
<I>as an additional argument. This will put the tracing spam into the </I><TT>foo.log</TT><I> file.</I></P>
<H2>Example program: finding text</H2>
<P><I>The examples are presented assuming they are all entered interactively, but they should all work when run
from a file, as above.</I></P>
<P>In this tutorial, you are going to write an E program that finds occurrences of a specific text string in a
file. You will need an example file to work with. Use a text editor to create a text file containing the following
stanzas of the poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>'Twas brillig and the slithy toves<BR>
	Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<BR>
	All mimsy were the borogoves,<BR>
	And the mome raths outgrabe.
	<P>&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<BR>
	The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<BR>
	Beware the Jubjub bird and shun<BR>
	The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Save the text in a file called jabberwocky.txt in the top level of your file system.
<H3>Loops: the for statement</H3>
<P>A loop is one or more statements to be executed multiple times. You use a for statement to create a loop.<BR>
Type the following for statement in the Program window:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<PRE>? for line in file:/jabberwocky.txt {
&gt;     print(line)
&gt; }</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After the first or second line, E knows it doesn't yet have a complete expression so it keeps prompting for
more. After typing the third line, you should see the contents of the file jabberwocky.txt:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>'Twas brillig and the slithy toves<BR>
	Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<BR>
	All mimsy were the borogoves,<BR>
	And the mome raths outgrabe.
	<P>&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<BR>
	The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<BR>
	Beware the Jubjub bird and shun<BR>
	The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>For every line found in the file jabberwocky.txt, the for statement prints the line to the display. It repeats
this operation until it has read all the lines in the file.
<H3>Functions</H3>
<P>The for statement you have written is good for printing the file jabberwocky.txt, but suppose you want to print
a different file? You would like to have the same code perform the same operation for any input you provide. A
function does just that.<BR>
<BR>
Add lines before and after the for statement and change the for statement so it looks like this:</P>
<PRE>	? define show(file) {
	&gt;     for line in file {
	&gt;         print(line)
	&gt;     }
	&gt; }
	&gt; show(file:/jabberwocky.txt )</PRE>
<P>As in the previous example, the contents of the file jabberwocky.txt are output in the Program window.
<H4>Function definition</H4>
<P>The define statement, which begins at the word define and ends at the last curly brace, }, defines a function
called show. Executing the define statement performs no action; it creates entities to be used later.
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<P>The show function contains the for statement operating on the variable file. The variable file is called the
function's parameter. An parameter is a placeholder for data provided when the function is executed. Wherever file
appears in the function definition, the actual data provided will be used.
<H4>Function call</H4>
<P>The last line is not part of the function definition. It is a function call: it executes the show function.
The name file:/jabberwocky.txt is given as the argument to the show function. You could execute the same function
for a different file by providing a different file name. (There is a space between the URL and the closing parenthesis
since parentheses are legal URL characters, but this parenthesis isn't supposed to be part of the URL.)
<H3>Conditions: the if statement</H3>
<P>Suppose you want to print only certain lines of a file, not all of them. Suppose you want to print only those
lines containing a text string you specify. Use the if statement to execute code only if a condition tests true.</P>
<P>Add lines before and after the print function call, change the name of the function to find, and add a second
argument to it, so that the function definition looks like this:</P>
<PRE>	? define find(file, substring) {
	&gt;     for line in file {
	&gt;         if (line includes(substring)) {
	&gt;             print(line)
	&gt;         }
	&gt;     }
	&gt; }</PRE>
<P>Add a second argument value to the function call:</P>
<PRE>	? find(file:/jabberwocky.txt, &quot;and&quot;)</PRE>
<P>Now only the lines in the file jabberwocky.txt that contain the string &quot;and&quot; are printed in the Program
window.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>'Twas brillig and the slithy toves<BR>
	Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<BR>
	Beware the Jubjub bird and shun<BR>
	The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The line that contains &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; is included because of the &quot;and&quot; in &quot;Bandersnatch&quot;.
The line that contains &quot;And&quot; is not included because the comparison is case-sensitive.</P>
<P>Try the function call again specifying a different text string.
<H3>Built-in functions and methods</H3>
<P>You have been using the print function to display text. The print function is a predefined function built into
E.<BR>
<BR>
A built-in method you use in this example is <TT>includes</TT>. This method is called on a string and takes another
string as an argument. It returns true if the argument string can be found within the string the method is called
on. In the method call:</P>
<PRE>	line includes(substring)</PRE>
<P><TT>line</TT> is the string that <TT>includes</TT> is called on, and <TT>substring</TT> is the<BR>
argument to <TT>includes</TT>.
<H2>Mappings: the =&gt; operator</H2>
<P>E supports several features that facilitate working with files. You have already used one of these features
in the function call:</P>
<PRE>	find(file:/jabberwocky.txt, &quot;and&quot;)</PRE>
<P>The prefix <TT>file:</TT> tells E to open the designated file and read its contents. In E, all collections are
mappings from keys of some sort to values of some sort. A for loop can be used on any collection. When used on
a file, the file is assumed to be a text file, and considered a collection mapping from line numbers (starting
at 1, since this is the text file convention) to corresponding lines of the file. Each time around the for loop,
the key is the next line number and the value is a string with the contents of that line (including a terminating
newline). So for your example file, the mapping is:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>1 'Twas brillig and the slithy toves<BR>
	2 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe <BR>
	3 All mimsy were the borogoves,<BR>
	4 And the mome raths outgrabe.<BR>
	5 <BR>
	6 &quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<BR>
	7 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<BR>
	8 Beware the Jubjub bird and shun<BR>
	9 The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You can access the keys of a mapping using the =&gt; operator. This operator is read <I>maps to</I>, as in &quot;k
=&gt; v&quot; reading &quot;k maps to v&quot;.</P>
<P>Add to the for statement and the print function call so your program looks like this:</P>
<PRE>	? define find(file, substring) {
	&gt;     for num =&gt; line in file {
	&gt;         if (line includes(substring)) {
	&gt;             print(&quot;&quot; + num + &quot;:&quot; + line)
	&gt;         }
	&gt;     }
	&gt; }
	&gt; find(file:/jabberwocky.txt, &quot;and&quot;)</PRE>
<P>You get the same lines that printed before, and now the lines are numbered.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>1:'Twas brillig and the slithy toves<BR>
	2:Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<BR>
	8:Beware the Jubjub bird and shun<BR>
	9:The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>String concatenation</H2>
<P>The + operator performs addition if its operands are numeric. When its left operand is a string, it performs
concatenation; it appends the second argument -- converted to a string -- to the end of the first and returns the
result. In the statement:</P>
<PRE>	print(&quot;&quot; + num + &quot;:&quot; + line)</PRE>
<P>the argument to the <TT>print</TT> function is a concatenation of four strings.</P>
<P>Why the empty string? The variable <TT>num</TT> actually contains a numeric value, not a string. The concatenation
succeeds because E automatically converts the numeric value in <TT>num</TT> to the equivalent string as a result
of trying to concatenate <TT>num</TT> with the empty string. If the expression began with <TT>num</TT><BR>
<BR>
print(num + &quot;:&quot; + line)<BR>
<BR>
E would expect a numeric value to add to num and would generate an exception when it encountered the string &quot;:&quot;
instead.</P>
<H2>Calling Java methods</H2>
<P>The E interpreter, which runs on Java, uses the Java class String to implement its strings. E strings are normal
Java String objects, instances of the Java class java.lang.String. This means that all of String's public methods,
the methods that belong to the class String and that can be called from outside String, are available to E strings.
Refer to <A HREF="../../API_doc/ec4/packages.html">javadoc-umentation</A> for information about Java classes.</P>
<P>Change the if statement condition:</P>
<PRE>	? define find(file, substring) {
	&gt;     for num =&gt; line in file {
	&gt;         if (line indexOf(substring) != -1) {
	&gt;             print(&quot;&quot; + num + &quot;:&quot; + line)
	&gt;         }
	&gt;     }
	&gt; }</PRE>
<P>You get the same result as before. Since line is a string, you can call the String method <TT>indexOf</TT>,
which returns the index (or position) of a specified substring if the substring exists, or -1 if the substring
is not found.
<H3>Calling a function from another function</H3>
<P>So far you have written a function that reads a specified file and prints out any lines containing a specified
string. To make good use of the function you have written, you would call it more than once.</P>
<P>Let's write another function that calls your function for all .txt files in a directory.</P>
<PRE>	? define findall(dir, substring) {
	&gt;     for file in dir {
	&gt;         if (file getName endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;)) {
	&gt;             find(file, substring)
	&gt;         }
	&gt;     }
	&gt; }
	&gt; findall(file:/, &quot;and&quot;)</PRE>
<P>You get at least the same result as before. If you have other .txt files in your top-level directory, and if
they contain the string &quot;and&quot;, you will get additional lines.
<H2>The File class</H2>
<P>The for statement</P>
<PRE>	for file in dir {</PRE>
<P>executes once for each element of dir. The elements of dir are File objects, instances of the java.io.File class.
On each iteration of the loop, the variable file contains a different File object.</P>
<P>The if statement</P>
<PRE>	if (file getName endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;)) {</PRE>
<P>contains two method calls:</P>
<PRE>	file getName </PRE>
<P>calls the <TT>getName</TT> method of the File class, which returns as a String the name of the file that the
File object represents.</P>
<PRE>	endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;) </PRE>
<P>calls the <TT>endsWith</TT> method of the String class, which returns true if the String object ends with the
specified argument string.
<H2>Recursion: calling a function from itself</H2>
<P>Now you have a function that checks all the files in a directory. However, it ignores subdirectories. It would
be useful if it could check files in subdirectories as well.</P>
<P>Checking subdirectories is tricky, because a directory tree can have any number of branches of any length. You
cannot know ahead of time how many levels of subdirectories to search. What you need is a way to say &quot;keep
going until you get to the end.&quot; Recursion provides this functionality. Recursion happens when a function
calls itself.</P>
<P>To create a simple directory tree to test, create a subdirectory in your top-level directory called <TT>test</TT>.
Make a copy of jabberwocky.txt and put the copy in the <TT>test</TT> subdirectory.</P>
<P>Change the <TT>findall</TT> function by renaming the dir argument and replacing the for statement with a compound
if statement:</P>
<PRE>	? define findall(dirfile, substring) {
	&gt;	if (dirfile isDirectory) {
	&gt;		for file in dirfile {
	&gt;			findall(file, substring)
	&gt;		}
	&gt;	} else if (dirfile getName endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;)) {
	&gt;		find(dirfile, substring)
	&gt;	}
	&gt; }
	&gt; findall(file:/, &quot;and&quot;)</PRE>
<P>You get (at least):


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>/jabberwocky.txt:1:'Twas brillig and the slithy toves<BR>
	/jabberwocky.txt:2:Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<BR>
	/jabberwocky.txt:8:Beware the Jubjub bird and shun<BR>
	/jabberwocky.txt:9:The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;<BR>
	/test/jabberwocky.txt:1:'Twas brillig and the slithy toves<BR>
	/test/jabberwocky.txt:2:Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<BR>
	/test/jabberwocky.txt:8:Beware the Jubjub bird and shun<BR>
	/test/jabberwocky.txt:9:The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>plus the lines containing &quot;and&quot; from any other .txt files you have anywhere in your file system.
<H3>Compound if statement</H3>
<P>The above if statement has a second clause, the else if block.</P>
<P>If the condition of the first clause is true, the first clause is executed and the second clause is ignored.</P>
<P>If the condition of the first clause is false, and the condition of the second clause is true, the second clause
is executed.</P>
<P>If the condition of the first clause is false, and the condition of the second clause is false, none of the
if statement is executed.</P>
<P>In this case, the variable dirfile will contain an object of the File class that represents either a directory
or a file. The first clause of the if statement is executed if the object in dirfile represents a directory. If
it does not, you know that the object represents a file. In that case, the second clause performs the string search
operation that you have been doing all along.</P>
<P>A danger in recursion is that with each function call, the function calls itself again, creating a never-ending
loop. In this example, the findall function will stop calling itself when it can find no more directories, which
has to happen eventually.

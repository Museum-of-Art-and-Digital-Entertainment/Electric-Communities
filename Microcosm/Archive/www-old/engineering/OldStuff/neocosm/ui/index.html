Many of the recommendations made here should be embracedas as-good-as-God's-own-Truth. Many of the other recommendations madehere should not be touched with a ten-metre-pole. I can't tell thedifference. Can you?<P>The feedback from the Alpha Testers has generally been varyfavorable, with the exception of two specific complaints:<OL>   <LI>The UI interactions are much too slow. When they issue a   command that opens a window (like the Pocket or Address Book) they   expect it to open and be operational immediately. They warn that a   lot of people will not use the system regularly if it is slow.      <LI>The Pie menus (or Star menus as some of the Alpha Testers call   them) take a lot of getting used to. They warn that the menus   could scare away a lot of users.</OL><P>This is the current state of the main window:<P><IMG SRC="before.gif" WIDTH=648 HEIGHT=570 ALIGN=bottom><H4>Related Documents</H4><P>The UI Spec. I have been using the 3.31.98 edition, which prettyclosely describes the Alpha system. Claire reports that earliereditions will be much more useful when reconsidering the NeoCosm UIdesign. Does anyone have a copy? This should be part of the documentbase.<P>The Habitat Help Pages.<H2>Main Window Size</H2><P>The size of the main window was fixed to deal with a couple ofconstraints:<OL>   <LI>The simple 2D region backdrops looked/worked best when   displayed with no change in scale.      <LI>The smallest screen size is 640 * 480.</OL><P>The interaction of those constraints inspired the current mainwindow dimensions. Unfortunately, the main window is too tall to fitin 480: The bottom button row is lost. Those buttons are notcompletely essential, all having keyboard equivalents.<P>A number of things have changed since that decision was made:<OL>   <LI>Our memory requirement grew to at least 32M. 640 * 480   monitors on 32M PCs are rare.      <LI>As monitors continue to grow, a modest, ungrowable window   looks increasingly dopey.      <LI>We are making much greater use of 3D regions, which do not   need to constrain screen size.      <LI>We added scene flattening features to the render, which   virtually eliminates the performance penalty that comes with   scaling.</OL><P>Recommendation: Make the size of the main window changeable by thecustomer. The minimum size will work on 640 displays. Allow wideningthe aspect ratio in regions. Excess vertical space will be used fordialog balloons.<P>[98/05/26 claire] Will this include making the window smaller?This involves different ui issues and we should be clear on what itmeans to make the window smaller.<P>[98/05/27 Bill] Large windows will have significant performanceimplications. However, at least it is up to the user.<H2>Dialogs vs Menus</H2><P>Currently, Cosm makes extensive use of dialogs. The pattern of usefor many of the dialogs is<OL>   <LI>Select an item from a list.      <LI>Click an activation button (Open, Teleport, etc.).      <LI>Close the dialog or click on the main window.</OL><P>This is what menus are for. Menus fulfill this pattern with lesscursor movement and less clicking. Menus also avoid operation errorscaused by the customer forgetting to bring the main window to frontbefore chatting.<P>Better use of menus would avoid the large number of windows thatCosm leaves lying around.<P>Recommendation: Use menus where appropriate. Many of the buttonswhich produce windows should produce menus instead.<P>[98/05/26 claire] Windows such as the teleport window supportseveral list. The original design also allowed searching, sorting andfiltering on any field. Are we going to do away with this ability? Weneed to beware of long unwieldy menus which result form "all thefoozits" type lists. A suggestion is keep the dialog but support amenu where the choices are some reasonable number of items orrestrict the list to recent or favorites. We should also consider theuse of command shortcuts.<P>[98/05/27 Bill] One of the most annoying "features" of the currentinterface is that the keyboard focus "randomly" changes as you bringup the ancillary windows. One example is when you select "add toaddress book" on an avatar and then continue to type chat. Sometime,part way through what you are typing, the focus changes and yourtyping is silently dropped. One solution would be to say that typingat the main window cancels the automatic focus change.<H2>"Look"</H2><P>There is a tension between wanting to look like other applications(so that people can apply the UI knowledge that they have alreadyacquired) and wanting to look different (superior to all those othertedious applications). This tension was intensified by AWT/IFC, whichmade <I>any</I> kind of UI difficult and tedious.<P>Recently, Sun has released Swing and a UI scheme called Metal.Metal moderates the 3D popping out look with flush surfaces. I thinkthat it is attractive, efficient, and functional.<P>Recommendation:<P>Adopt as much of Swing/Metal as makes sense.<P>[98/05/26 claire] I don't believe we should be in the business ofadopting <I>any</I> look and feel in a "branded micro-network". Weshould support customizability not a customized look. JFC/Swingallows this kind of support. As we understand the cost ofcustomization of Swing widgets we can make it clear to customers whatthe cost of this will be for choosing their own look. The customer isalways right.<H2>Watermark</H2><P>The watermark provides some important functions:<OL>   <LI>It provides access to the region's menu.      <LI>It also provides access to the program's menu.      <LI>It identifies the region and its theme, or source, or terms of   service. Or something.</OL><P>The watermark has these problems:<OL>   <LI>Both region and program commands are on the same menu. (Very   minor. This doesn't bug anybody except the author.)      <LI>Program commands (particularly Save) are not available in   regions without watermarks.      <LI>The watermark in some cases is hard to see.      <LI>The watermark clutters the scene.      <LI>The watermark doesn't look like a widget that would provide   access to a menu.</OL><P>Recommendation: Remove the watermark from the Cosm pane. Instead,create 3 new buttons on the command bar. The buttons will be labeledwith bitmaps which can carry logos or themes.<OL>   <LI><A NAME="The_Program_button"></A>The Program button.   (Double-wide.) Its image identifies the source of the program. It   can be changed as part of Branded Micronet in a Box packaging.   Clicking on it brings up a menu of program functions such as Save,   Quit, Connect/Disconnect, Customize, and Operator functions.      <LI><A NAME="The_Realm_button"></A>The Realm button. (Quad-wide.)   Identifies the server we are attached to. Clicking it brings up a   menu of Realm functions, including Welcome, BBS, Map, Events,   People, Teleport, Member Services, and I Need Help!      <LI>The Terms of Service Button. (Quad-wide.) Identifies the TOS   policy in effect in the current region. Clicking on it brings up a   menu of TOS functions, including Show Policy, Submit for Approval,   Set My Policy.</OL><P><IMG SRC="watermark.gif" WIDTH=571 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=bottom><P>[98/05/26 claire] I agree with everything except the create threebuttons part. First, there is problem with truncating long names tofit some fixed button size or picking mnemonics. Second, the ideathat there is one and only one policy in force for a given region isjust plain wrong, what about an adult region which doesn't allowuncertified art? I'd prefer we have a TOS icon that is distinctivewhen some TOS policy is in force.<P>[98/05/27 Bill] Do we want to have the TOS always visible toshoulder surfers?<P>The Adults Only tag above is clearly wrong. TOS should be framedas permissions, not as restrictions. And it looks like text, when itshould look like graphics.<H3>Customize</H3><P>The Customize command on the<A HREF="#The Program button">Program</A> menu allows for changingthe gesture and expression buttons.<P>[98/05/26 claire] The original design of those bars was a titlebar which allowed you to select from all available gestures orexpressions and select the ones which would be readily available. Ithink we should revisit the earlier triaged design. Keeping the pointof control close to thing that is being controlled is a much betterdesign.<P><IMG SRC="pie.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=355 ALIGN=right><H2>Pie Menus</H2><P>Pie Menus appeared in the original Habitat as a way of loadingfour commands (Get, Put, Go, and Do) onto an Atari joystick. A muchmore sophisticated pie menu is used in Cosm. Should it continue intoNeoCosm? Fortunately, we have real customer experience from the Alphatest to inform the next set of choices. Customers report that theirfirst impression is confusion.<H3>Round vs Linear</H3><P>Pie menus are new. Any innovation must provide a higher level ofperformance, otherwise it increases the cost of learning withoutincreasing value. In my opinion, pie menus in the Cosm application donot provide enough value. They do not work enough better than linearmenus. In particular, the diagonal commands are hard to reach(Wear,Swatch). The 12-command menus are probably too difficult touse.<H3>Click and Flick</H3><P>Click and Flick is a gestural variation of pie menus which allowscommon commands to be issued with just a flick. Unfortunately in theCosm application, flicks alias with clicks and so unintended commandscan be issued. Cosm lacks an Undo command, so there is no simpleremedy. Click and Flick may be well suited to pen applications, butnot to Cosm.<H3>Drag</H3><P>Our implementation of Pie Menus is incompatible with dragging.Dragging can be useful. We can't do it.<H3>Keyboard Shortcuts</H3><P>There should be keyboard shortcuts for the pie commands. There are8 commands around the pie, so the shortcuts could be Alt+1 thruAlt+8. But that means you click on the object to identify it, thenput down the mouse and press Alt+1. That isn't much of a shortcut.This requires some study.<P>&nbsp;[98/05/26 claire] I prefer pie menus partly because theycenter the eye on the object you're working on. I also think linearmenus have many of the same problems. They differ only in that theconventions for solving the problems are worked out. If you removethe click-n-flick capability you CAN drag things. Pie submenus needto be fixed. There are several working formats for submenus. I woulddefinitely prefer we wait for user feedback on this one.<H2>Command Buttons</H2><P>The Command Buttons currently open dialog boxes. In some cases,they would be more effective if they brought up menus. The advantagesof using menus instead of dialogs are speed and the focus stays inthe main window.<P><IMG SRC="menu.gif" WIDTH=321 HEIGHT=252 ALIGN=right><H3>People</H3><P>Clicking the People button pops up a menu containing:<UL>   <LI>Open Address Book      <LI>Region &gt;      <LI>Realm &gt;      <LI>the list of your friends</UL><P>Each name has a submenu containing<UL>   <LI>View Address Book Page      <LI>Send Telepathy      <LI>Send Email      <LI>Voice Chat      <LI>Teleport to Turf      <LI>Teleport to Avatar (only with Realm &gt;, and only if the   avatar is in a teleportable destination)</UL><H4>Region &gt;</H4><P>This brings up a submenu of all of the avatars in the region. Thisreplaces the Who's In Here command.<H4>Realm &gt;</H4><P>This brings up a submenu of all of the avatars in the realm; alsoshowing the region each avatar is in. This replaces the Where IsEveryone command.<P>[98/05/26 claire] This is <I>exactly</I> the kind of list, whichseems fine while testing with 10 people but would be ridiculous with50 or a 100. I don't believe we will consider this product much of asuccess if we never have 100 people in a realm at once. Furthermore,there is no way to do a sort or search on the list. You just have toscroll until you come to the name you want.<P>Claire is correct. The Realm submenu would be a big mistake.<H4>Address Book</H4><P>(This discussion does not include study of the Buddy Listsdeveloped at The Palace and at OnLive. We should look at those BuddyLists.)<P>The Address Book should have 4 divisions:<OL>   <LI>Me (containing my own personal data and privilege/privacy   settings)      <LI>My Directory (a list of people I have encountered)      <LI>Detail (the detail page of one person)      <LI>Groups (are we doing groups?)</OL><P>The current Address Book combines My Directory and Detail, makingthe Directory the first page of the Detail, which does not workwell.I recommend<UL>   <LI>Making Remove available on each People page. In Cosm, its is   extremely difficult to prune the people list.      <LI>Make Telepathy, Email, Chat, Teleport, and Friend available on   the Directory.      <LI>There is a Find command that doesn't work. Fix it or drop it.      <LI>There is a misplaced Opens the Directory of people button.   Drop it.</UL><P>[98/05/26 claire] This is another window that was triaged into itscurrent state. I'd like to start with the original designs and workfrom there.<H3>Catalog</H3><P>The Catalog Catalog window is unnecessary. Instead, bring up apop-up menu containing the names of the separate catalogs.<P>If we ever need commands to create or acquire catalogs, theyshould also go on this menu.<H4>Turfs Catalog</H4><P>Problems with the Turfs Catalog:<OL>   <LI>The title of the Window is "Functional.turfs". Ridiculous. It   should say "Turfs" or "Turfs Catalog".      <LI>The window should be much larger. It is narrow so that it can   share screen real estate with the main window, but it doesn't need   to share. Make the window size generous.      <LI>The scrolling vertical tabs are horrible. Most people seeing   this window for the first time think there are only two turfs in   the catalog. Instead, make it work more like a Class Browser:   There is a list of Turf Names. You can easily go through the list   to see all of the turfs (TAB or DOWNARROW, rather than   Click-scroll-arrow &amp; Click-Turftab).      <LI>Description: Allow renaming the turf at the time it is   created.      <LI>Approvals: This is currently just a placeholder. This needs to   be hooked up for Negative TOS to work.</OL><H3>Inventory</H3><P>The Inventory window is the worst window in Cosm. The problemsare:<OL>   <LI>It is very slow to bring up the full window. So first it   displays an empty window so that you have some immediate feedback,   but the corrected display is so long in coming that you can get   the impression that the inventory is empty. This reeks.      <LI>The inventory is organized very poorly: A single list sorted   by original object name. Give options to show it by containership   hierarchy at least.      <LI>Show as much user customization as possible. Currently, it   shows original names only, so there is no way to distinguish   between similar objects. (General comment: The naming of names is   a serious matter.)      <LI>Popular properties (like Nail down) should be viewable and   changeable in the list. A turf decorator will want to see that all   of the objects in a region have been properly secured.</OL><P>[98/05/26 claire] I believe this window was <I>heavily</I>triaged. A review of the original design document is needed here.<H3>Map &amp; Event</H3><P>The Map &amp; Event buttons may not be needed if we have a<A HREF="#The Realm button">Realm button</A>.<H3>Teleport</H3><P>Clicking on the Teleport button pops up a menu containing<UL>   <LI>&lt;teleport status advisory&gt;      <LI>Realm &gt;      <LI>Recent &gt;      <LI>Add to Favorites      <LI>Edit Favorites...      <LI>the favorites</UL><H4>&lt;teleport status advisory&gt;</H4><P>This indicates if a teleportation is currently in progress, or ifteleportation is now possible. (Is it possible to have this cancel ateleportation in progress? Today, it would be used to escape fromcontainership errors. Someday, it could be used to escape from slowerobnoxious servers.)<H4>Realm &gt;</H4><P>Realm is a submenu of destinations provided by this Realm.<H4>Recent &gt;</H4><P>Recent is a submenu of recently visited regions, most recent atthe top, no duplicates.<H4>Add to Favorites</H4><P>Adds this Region to the Favorites list.<H4>Edit Favorites</H4><P>Dialog allows removing regions from the Favorites list, or addingregions from the Realm or Recent to the Favorites list.<P>Also, provide for creating a portal to any place on the Favorites,Realm, or Recent list.<H3>Pocket</H3><P>A Pocket Button should be added. It replaces the Open Pocketcommand on the Avatar menu.<P>Clicking Pocket pops-up a menu of the contents of the pocket.Click on an object to move it to the Avatar's hand. If the Avatar'shand is already full, the object the Avatar was already holding ismoved to the pocket.<P>[98/05/26 claire] The problem I have with pocket is that is muchmore like the typical inventory window used in games than it is apocket. The problem with a simple text menu:<OL>   <LI>The contents of the pocket are arbitrarily large.      <LI>The names of things are not unique so you can either have   multiple named things and guess which is which or have a single   item showing and hope it's the right one.      <LI>Currently the pocket window lets you interact with the object,   which means you can disambiguate the duplicate items.</OL><P>The pocket would work better if it were treated as the quickaccess list. This is often used in games to shortcut your inventory.Your pocket would have a finite number of slots. Any item you pickedup could end up in your pocket as long as you had room. You can thenuse a command to add an item into your pocket or move an item out ofyour pocket back into main inventory. Alternately, the pocket issimple the most recent items you've added to your inventory. The menubecomes much more manageable. Your larger inventory window allows youto deal with the object directly. I don't know about the currentinventory window that is trying to be something else again.<P><IMG SRC="balloon.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=404 ALIGN=right><H2>Balloons</H2><H3>Vertical spacing</H3><P>The vertical padding around the text in balloon should be cut inhalf. This will give us a tighter look. The horizontal padding is ok.<H3>Combining balloons</H3><P>Combine balloons from the same speaker with the same styletogether into a single balloon. This will improve the visual flow oflong speeches, making the restriction on entry balloon-length moretolerable. Balloons will not be combined if the resulting balloonwould be too large.<P>[98/05/26 claire] currently the main restriction for balloon entrylength is that the speech would be too large. In our current font,you always reach the maximum balloon size <I>before</I> you reach themaximum character count. If what you mean is two sequentialutterances, which are in the same style by the same person, should betreated as a single utterance, than I disagree.<P>No, the current restriction on balloon length is to reduce chatlatency. Since the balloon isn't transmitted until it is complete,long speeches will be preceded by a very long delay. Limiting entrymeans speeches must be broken into shorter bursts, which reduceslatency, but is a drag.<P>My proposal is to keep the limitation on entry, but to reassemblethe subspeeches into a longer ones. <H3>Quips</H3><P>Quips should be removed when the speaking avatar moves.<H3>Clearing</H3><P>If time passes without any balloon activity, then scroll theballoons up. Eventually, the screen will clear.<P>[98/05/26 claire] This feature was triaged out<H3>Balloon Region</H3><P>The region designer should be able to specify for each camera therectangle that will contain all of the balloons, including a nullrectangle to turn off balloons completely (requiring use of Log forchat). The left and right limits will be useful in game regions. Thetop and bottom limits can be used to move the balloons to the bottomof the screen, like movie subtitles.<H3>Emote</H3><P>Alpha Testers have complained that they want to be able to use theemote balloons without having their names inserted. Some even thoughtthat the name insertion was a bug. <P>Proposal: Allow backspace to remove the avatar name from emoteballoons, similar to the way backspace and remove an address from anESP balloon.<H2>Objects</H2><H3>Portal</H3><P>All portals and Portaportals should provide an Add to Favoritescommand.<P>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>

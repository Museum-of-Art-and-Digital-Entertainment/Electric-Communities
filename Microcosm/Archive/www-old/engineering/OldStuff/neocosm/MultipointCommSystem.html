Introduction</H2>
Our comm system's relationship with our system (the MC application) currently
looks something like this:

<P><IMG SRC="pt2ptstacks.gif" HEIGHT=369 WIDTH=582>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;The main point of this figure is to show that for our current
comm system, we are heavily loading our communication needs on top of what
is basically a point-to-point communication abstraction...that is, TCP.&nbsp;
This works just fine for supporting all of our object-to-object communication
needs at the E-level, as it supplies reliability (provided by TCP's error
correction structure), and ordering guarantees (since point-to-point ordering
follows naturally from a reliable of a point-to-point connection).

<P>But what our current comm system does not supply is multipoint messaging
(1 sender and n receivers).&nbsp; In our current system, this multipoint
messaging functionality is supplied by the Pluribus layer on top of the
E comm system, and is modelled as a set of point-to-point relations between
objects (e.g. between a host and all its clients).&nbsp; This structure
can work OK, but has several undersireable properties:

<P>1)&nbsp; The Pluribus layer and even some of the ingredient code (e.g.
containership) is dependent upon the network topology (star, network, multicast,
etc).&nbsp; Since the multipoint messaging functions are provided by the
Pluribus layer and above, and they are modelled as a set of point-to-point
links, this means that the Pluribus layer (and to some degree the containership
code as well) is dependent upon the network topology for the multipoint
messaging that we need.&nbsp; This means that if (e.g.) we wanted to go
to another network topology for delivering the same set of services (e.g.
multicast tree for efficiency reasons), then we would have to re-architect,
re-design, and re-write large portions of our system, including the comm
system itself, the Pluribus distributed object layer, and a good degree
of our essential ingredient code (containership).&nbsp; This would not
be good, and in my view it means that there is something wrong with our
choice of messaging abstractions.

<P><A NAME="membership"></A>2)&nbsp; Layers outside the comm system are
responsible for implementing a property that our multipoint messaging application
requires:&nbsp; <B>reliability</B><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT></SUP>.&nbsp;
We <B>need </B>the notion of reliability in multipoint messaging for some
aspects of our application (i.e. we can't do without it).&nbsp; The reason
for this is that some notion of multipoint reliability is needed to solve
the <I>distributed consensus problem</I>, and the <I>distributed consensus
problem</I> must be solved by our app to provide (e.g.) reliable containership.&nbsp;
<B>Note:&nbsp; without solving the distributed consensus problem, our infrastructure
will not be robust at an infrastructure level.&nbsp; This is not a good
property to build upon and is a property that may keep others from doing
significant things with our code</B>.

<P>Note also that building a star topology on multiple reliable point-to-point
links (i.e. with TCP as the transport for all the links), does not provide
reliable multipoint messaging.&nbsp; To realize this, consider the following
example:&nbsp; say we have three processes, A, B, and C.&nbsp; They are
connected in a star topology like so:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \
<BR>&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C

<P>Now, if the link between A and C goes down, then A and C will know about
it because of TCP's reliability guarantees, but unless something more is
done, B will not know about this failure, and it will also not know about
any failure in its messaging to C (or if a single message from B is intended
for both A and C).

<P>This is where the role for group membership comes in.&nbsp; Assuming
some group membership algorithm, whose basic responsibility is to provide
information about the group membership to all participants, then B can
be informed of the membership change when the link between A and C goes
down.&nbsp; For this trivial example, the obvious solution is to have A
communicate the group membership change to B in the form of a membership
change message.&nbsp; This is the sole function group membership, but it
is a very important function.&nbsp; Actually, there is some interesting
work showing that reliable multicast is a basic requirement for both the
virtual synchrony and the transaction approaches to synchronizing distributed
state.&nbsp; See here for a reference: http://lsewww.epfl.ch/~rachid/papers/dist.html
(see the paper entitled <B>The Transaction Model vs The Virtual Synchrony
Model: Bridging the gap</B>).
<H2>
<A NAME="figure"></A>Alternatives</H2>
One alternative structure is given by the following diagram:

<P><IMG SRC="multipointprotocolstack.GIF" HEIGHT=431 WIDTH=614>

<P>The point of this is to show that it would be possible to have a 'multipoint
messaging' abstraction provided as part of the E comm system (call it Mult-E).&nbsp;
This abstraction would make the layers above it (Pluribus layer and applications
above it able to use a multipoint messaging abstraction with two nice properties:&nbsp;
a) it would not have to know about the network topology...and therefore
it would allow the network topology to change without the application level
code having to change; and b) would provide a reliable multicast messaging
abstraction, and make it unnecessary for the higher layers to worry about
the needs of implementing a group membership algorithm, or assuring the
desired multipoint ordering properties (whichever ones are determined necessary
given our application requirements...assuming that at least sender-order
[FIFO] will be required, but other ordering properties may be needed depending
upon application requirements).
<H3>
Comm System</H3>
There are three main parts to the revised comm system.&nbsp; For the lowest
layer, the data comm layer see the <A HREF="NewECommSystem.html">New E
Data Comm System</A>.&nbsp; Above this is the object-to-object transport
(by copy layer).&nbsp; See the <A HREF="ObjectTransport.html">Object Transport</A>
document for a description of this layer.&nbsp; The third and topmost layer
of the point-to-point messaging system is the 'Object by Reference' layer
of the comm system, which does transparent proxy creation through maintenance
of import/export tables.&nbsp; This is a critical piece of functionality
for many kinds of point-to-point applications.&nbsp; For example, the '<A HREF="http://www.caplet.com">three-party
handoff</A>' problem, <A HREF="Telepathy.html">telepathy</A>, <A HREF="../design_notes/identity.html">secure
identity</A> and any other pt-to-pt messaging that is dependent upon secure
object-to-object asynchronous messaging.&nbsp; Fortunately, we already
have all of this infrastructure and will use it as necessary.

<P>A second important aspect of our communications system is support for
multipoint messaging.&nbsp; Multipoint messaging has a few characteristics
that make it different from pt-to-pt messaging:&nbsp; 1) Reliability is
not nearly as simple (and is fundamentally based upon reliable group membership);
2) There are many more varieties of message delivery ordering; 3) The notion
of a return value or 'promise' is not typically useful (it would typically
result in "ack implosion" to have a return value associated with a message
going to [e.g.] 10,000 recipients).&nbsp; Therefore, I believe it makes
sense to have our comm system specifically support multipoint messaging
as well as pt-to-pt messaging, so that these layers of our comm system
can provide appropriate abstractions for the upper layers of our system.
<H3>
Multipont Messaging:&nbsp; Network Topology</H3>
One question that immediately arises in multipoint messaging is:&nbsp;
what is the network topology?&nbsp; There are many topologies possible
to deliver multipoint messaging (actually, for those of you that are interested,
there are a <B>very</B> large number of topologies for interconnecting
n machines...it's basically the same as the number of partitions of n objects,
which grows very, very quickly).&nbsp; In any event, from the point of
view of clients of a multipont comm system, network topology is not typically
important, and so it makes sense to <B>hide the network topology</B> from
the clients of a multipoint comm system.&nbsp; This is possible, because
one can define an abstraction that presents a reliable multipoint messaging
abstraction to client objects, but hides from them the underlying network
topology that is used to deliver that reliable multipoint messaging.&nbsp;
For example, this is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.imtc.org">T.120
multipoint data communications standard</A>, and it provides an abstraction
that is both very useful, and very general.&nbsp; This is the key abstraction
that should define the multipoint comm system.&nbsp; Bob Schumaker's&nbsp;
document on an "<A HREF="ObjectMultiCast.html">Object Multicast</A>" does
an excellent job of describing the advantages of network topology independence
for multipoint messaging, and I believe that defining a layer that is topology
independent should be the main focus of our multipoint comm system layer.

<P>In the <A HREF="DObjects.html">DObjects work</A>, the local access to
the 'group' or 'session that defines a multipoint session (group) is called
the '<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember</A>'.&nbsp;
This object is a 'local representative' of the session, and provides the
messaging interfaces for sending multipoint messages between presences
of a distributed object.&nbsp; All it does is provide these messaging interfaces
(<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#sendDataToPresences(ec.dom.net.DObjectPacket)">sendDataToPresences</A>,
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#sendDataToPresenceAtSession(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.net.DObjectPacket)">sendDataToPresenceAtSession</A>).&nbsp;
The SessionMember also provides access to some interfaces for getting 'meta' information
about the group itself (i.e. the current group membership...e.g. <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#getCurrentGroupMembers()">getCurrentGroupMembers</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#isGroupManager()">isGroupManager</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#joinGroup(ec.dom.session.SessionID)">joinGroup</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#leaveGroup(ec.dom.session.SessionID)">leaveGroup</A>,
and etc.).
<H3>
Multipoint Messaging:&nbsp; Membership</H3>
A key piece of functionality for delivering reliable multipoint messaging
is group membership.&nbsp; <A HREF="#membership">As discussed above</A>,
reliable multipoint messaging and membership are tightly coupled.&nbsp;
Any abstraction that purports to provide a reliable messaging service must,
in essence, define and implement a reliable group membership algorithm.&nbsp;
This is why so much attention in the distributed systems literature has
been focussed around the problem of algorithms for maintaining accurate
group membership information in a distributed system.&nbsp; This has lead
to a 'contest' in essence for defining the weakest group membership algorithm
that satisfactorily solves distributed consensus.&nbsp; The final result:&nbsp;
In a paper entitled:&nbsp; <I>The Weakest Failure Detector for Solving
Consensus</I> by Chandra, Hadzilacos, and Toueg the authors show that the
weakest group membership detector capable of solving distributed consensus
is theoretically one that is limited to n/2 -1 errors (where n is the number
of participating processes).&nbsp; This is the weakest failure detector
that will work to solve distributed consensus.

<P>Note that the difficulty of implementing an accurate failure detector
depends primarily upon the network topology:&nbsp; <b>it is trivial</b> for a
star topology (the one we are currently focussed on in the short term), quite difficult for a multicast tree topology.&nbsp; The
value of having such a membership algorithm in the multipoint messaging
abstraction is that the specific implementation is hidden in the same way
that the network topology is hidden...clients only need to know that it
is done 'accurately' (with fewer than n/2 - 1 errors).  The whole point of this
discussion, however, is to introduce an abstraction which allows client code
to be 'topology independent'.  Given that we are using a star topology for now,
this only becomes valueable as an approach when we wish to use some other 
topology than a star and are able to do so easily rather than having to rearchitect
our entire system.
<H3>
Multipoint Messaging:&nbsp; What is shared with the rest of our comm system?</H3>
Essentially, if you break down what is in just in the box represented by
the "Comm System" box in the <A HREF="#figure">diagram above</A>, you have
three basic components to the comm system.&nbsp; The Data Comm layer is
the lowest layer, primarily responsible for the connection management,
wire protocol, data streaming, reliability and ordering, and exception
handling parts of our comm system.&nbsp; These requirements and a description
of the Data Comm layer are given in the <A HREF="NewECommSystem.html">New
E Comm System Document</A>.&nbsp; Another layer is the "Object Transfer"
layer, which is essentially responsible for sending arbitrary Serializable
objects over the Data Comm layer.&nbsp; It is dependent upon the Data Comm
layer.&nbsp; The following diagram produced by Bob Schumaker shows the
relationship between the Data Comm and the Object Transfer layers:

<P><IMG SRC="CommSystemDiagram.gif" HEIGHT=635 WIDTH=544>

<P>Both of these two 'low' layers of the comm system (Data Comm and Object
Transfer) are relevant to both the pt-to-pt messaging between objects,
as well as the multipoint communication layers.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, both
the pt-to-pt object messaging structure (shown above as "Exportable Object",
and in the <A HREF="#figure">diagram above</A> as "EC5 Pt-to-Pt Messaging"),
and to the multipoint messaging layer.&nbsp; This relationship between
these modules is described by another one of Bob's figures:

<P><IMG SRC="NewCommSystem.gif" HEIGHT=463 WIDTH=520>

<P>With this architectural approach among these three subsystems, it allows
a good deal of reuse of functionality and code...that is both the Data
Comm and Object Comm layers of the comm system need only to be implemented/debugged
once, and they can provide all of the functionality to support both the
pt-2-pt ("Point-to-point Proxy Object") messaging and the multipoint ("Group
proxy object") messaging structures.
<H3>
API Design</H3>
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/package-summary.html">Here is a proposed javadoc API
for the multipoint comm system</A>.

<P>Here is a diagram showing the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember
class</A> API and how it relates to the primary facet interface class,
the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html">SessionDObjectFacet:</A>

<P><A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html"><IMG SRC="ViewClass.jpg" HEIGHT=725 WIDTH=1130></A>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<B>Security</B></H3>
All of the methods on the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember</A>
class itself are declared '<B>protected</B>'.&nbsp; The reason for this
is that all direct access to this object will only be granted to <B>trusted
system code</B> (and these access classes must be declared as members of
the same package).&nbsp; All untrusted code (i.e. code from outside the
dom.session package), will be unable to call the protected methods on this
class directly, even if provided a reference to the SessionMember object.&nbsp;
This is a strong guarantee provided by the java interpreter, that we can
depend upon for providing capabilities secure access to the SessionMember's functionality.&nbsp;
For example, in good capabilities security manner, there is a facet class
instance passed to (untrusted) DObject clients of this API called the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html">SessionDObjectFacet</A>,
which only exposes publicly the critical methods available on this API
(I've adopted the convention of naming facet classes with the &lt;name
of underlying class>&lt;name of receiver class>Facet...this is open to
change if people identify a better facet class naming scheme).
<H3>
Functionality</H3>
This class provides the basic functionality for supporting our basic multipoint
Unum/Presence messaging model.&nbsp; Specifically, in addition to the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html">SessionDObjectFacet</A>
class providing secure basic messaging primitives for DObjects, it provides
interfaces for joining and leaving a multipoint distributed group (<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#joinGroup(ec.dom.session.SessionID)">joinGroup</A>
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#leaveGroup(ec.dom.session.SessionID)">leaveGroup</A>,
respectively).&nbsp; These methods expose the basic ability for clients
(that have access to this interface) to control the joining and leaving
of a multipoint group (this would, for example, be used by a trusted object
[e.g. avatar] to control the joining and leaving of 'virtual world' groups
[i.e. regions]).&nbsp; A facet class does not yet exist for this functionality,
but would be trivial to add.

<P>This API provides two major (related) services for clients:&nbsp; 1)
It maintains accurate information about group membership.&nbsp; 'Group
membership' is defined in terms of the other <B><A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMembers</A>
</B>that currently make up this distributed group (<B><A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMembers</A>
</B>have a many-to-one relationship with <B>processes</B>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
This API supports the accurate local tracking of distributed group membership.&nbsp;
The most important reason for providing this service is to be able to make
strong guarantees to client code of the <B>reliability </B>of the two multipoint
messaging interfaces (see 4 below).&nbsp; See <A HREF="#membership">above</A>
for a discussion of the importance of group membership to reliability,
and the relevance of multipoint reliability to our application.

<P>From the perspective of the DObject code that uses the service provided
by the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember</A>, there
are only two key messaging interfaces provided by this class:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#sendDataToPresences(ec.dom.net.DObjectPacket)">sendDataToPresences</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#sendDataToPresenceAtSession(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.net.DObjectPacket)">sendDataToPresenceAtSession</A>).&nbsp;
These are the basic messaging interfaces provided to client code (note
that the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html">SessionDObjectFacet</A>
class hides the specification of the ID receiver, meaning that the
DObject can only direct messages to its own presences).&nbsp; These provide
a service critical to the Unum/Presence model:&nbsp; reliable multipoint
delivery of arbitrary messages to remote presences of client objects.&nbsp;
That is, they do not deliver multipoint messages to any client receivers...rather
they only deliver messages between processes to <B>remote presences</B>
of a given object.

<P>The <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember</A> also
provides basic DObject construction/destruction services.&nbsp; For example,
to create an arbitrary distributed object that is locally hosted, there
is an interface:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#createDObject(ec.dom.session.DObject, ec.identity.ID, ec.dom.session.SessionID, java.net.URL, java.lang.String, java.lang.Object, boolean)">createDObject</A>,
that creates a distributed object that is hosted within this SessionMember.&nbsp;
This is a completely generic creation interface, and supports the general
meta-object function of creation.&nbsp; Conversely, there is an interface
for generic destruction, <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#destroyDObject(ec.identity.ID)">destroyDObject</A>,
that is responsible for locally destroying a distributed object presence.&nbsp;
Note for construction that the createDObject interface calls a constructor
with a certain method signature...for example:&nbsp; the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html">DObject
constructor</A>.

<P>The <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html">DObject root
class</A> is intended to be the root class for all distributed objects.&nbsp;
It has the same incarnation for both host and client presences of a given
subclass.&nbsp; Essentially, the job of the DObject subclass creator is
to define the app-specific behavior, and use the functionality provided
by the root <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html">DObject
class</A> (and override that functionality if appropriate and available):

<P>1)&nbsp; An identity (globally unique identifier) for each distributed
object.&nbsp; See the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#myID">myID
field</A> in the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html">DObject
class</A>.
<BR>2)&nbsp; A sessionmember id that represents the location of the 'home' sessionmember for this DObject.&nbsp;
See the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#myHomeSessionID">myHomeSessionID
field</A> in the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html">DObject
class.</A> This allows the local presence to determine whether it is a
client or host, and to be able to communicate directly with the host (if
a client).
<BR>3)&nbsp; Creation and distribution of client presences.&nbsp; See the
following DObject class methods:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#createClient(ec.dom.session.CreateClientInfo)">createClient</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#createClientDone(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.session.CreateClientResultInfo)">createClientDone</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#getStateForClient(ec.dom.session.SessionID)">getStateForClient</A>.&nbsp;
These methods are called from createClient, which is the entry point method
for client creation, called asynchronously in response to a message from
the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember class</A>, and
may be overridden by subclasses as appropriate.
<BR>4)&nbsp; State change notification.&nbsp; When the DObject presence
changes its state (either explicitly [hosts] or as a result of partition
[clients]), the SessionMember class sends it notification about its state change.&nbsp;
In response to these asynchronous notifications, the DObject root class
has some methods that are declared <B>final</B> that handle these messages
to do basic initialization and shutdown (i.e. shutdown that DObjects' access
to the run queue, etc.).&nbsp; These final methods are:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#create(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">create</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#activate(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">activate</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#deactivate(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">deactivate</A>,
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#destroy(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">destroy</A>.&nbsp;
The activate and deactivate methods generate another asynchronous message,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#activated(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">activated</A>
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#deactivated(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">deactivated</A>,
respectively, that are subclass overrideable, allowing subclasses to define
specific behavior to happen on basic activation and deactivation as desired
by overriding <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#activated(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">activated</A>
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#deactivated(ec.dom.session.SessionNotifyInfo)">deactivated</A>.
<BR>5)&nbsp; Basic messaging support to remote presences.&nbsp; This is
the most important service provided by the DObject root class for subclasses.&nbsp;
The service is provided (ultimately) by the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html#sendDataToPresences(ec.dom.util.Data)">SessionDObjectFacet.sendDataToPresences</A>,
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html#sendDataToPresenceAtSession(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.util.Data)">SessionDObjectFacet.sendDataToPresenceAtSession</A>
methods.&nbsp; The DObject class exposes some utility methods to subclasses
to make it easy for them to deliver messages in the common messaging pattern
(i.e. from clients to their host presence, and from the host to all client
presences).&nbsp; These methods are:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#sendDataToRemote(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.util.Data)">DObject.sendDataToRemote</A>,
<A HREF="dobjects/dom/docs/dom.session.DObject.html#sendClosureToHost(dom.session.Closure)">DObject.sendClosureToHost</A>,
and <A HREF="dobjects/dom/docs/dom.session.DObject.html#sendClosureToRemotes(dom.session.Closure)">DObject.sendClosureToRemotes</A>.&nbsp;
The <A HREF="dobjects/dom/docs/dom.session.Closure.html">Closure</A> class
is a class to represent an arbitrary Closure or code block (also can be
called an Envelope).
<BR>6)&nbsp; Some 'meta' interfaces that allow DObject subclasses to query
about themselves.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#isClientPresence()">DObject.isClientPresence</A>
allows subclass code to determine if it is a client or host presence.&nbsp;
There are other meta interfaces for getting the SessionDObjectFacet (<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#getSessionMember()">getSessionMember</A>),
getting the local view's ID (<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#getSessionMemberID()">getSessionMemberID</A>),
adding and removing oneself as a 'listener' for the arrival and departure
of other DObjects (<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#addDObjectListener()">addDObjectListener</A>/<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html#removeDObjectListener()">removeDObjectListener</A>)
and the actual notification methods for these notifications:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#otherActivated(ec.identity.ID)">otherActivated</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#otherDeactivated(ec.identity.ID)">otherDeactivated</A>.
<BR>7)&nbsp; Serveral interfaces to support the exchange of capabilities
between presences:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#sendRequestForCapability(ec.identity.ID, java.lang.String, java.lang.Object)">sendRequestForCapability</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#requestCapability(ec.dom.session.CapabilityReceipt)">requestCapability</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionDObjectFacet.html#receiveCapability(ec.dom.session.CapabilityReceipt)">receiveCapability</A>.
<BR>8)&nbsp; An interface for requesting more capabilities from the local
SessionMember (e.g. access to UI/Other I/O, etc) called <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#getSessionFacet(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object)">getSessionFacet</A>.
<BR>9)&nbsp; There are a number of other utility methods that allow the
subclass DObject to customize its own message handling and other aspects
of its fundamental behavior (e.g. <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#runClosure(ec.dom.session.Closure)">runClosure</A>,
<A HREF="dobjects/dom/docs/dom.session.DObject.html#initialize()">initialize</A>,
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#setInitialState(java.io.Serializable)">setInitialState</A>,

DObject Subclasses:&nbsp; ComponentDObject</H3>
There is a subclass of DObject called <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/CompositeDObject.html">CompositeDObject</A>.&nbsp;
This subclass was written to provide some support that we have in our current
model for 'Ingredients'.&nbsp; (The notions of 'ingredient' and 'component'
are exactly the same...I only used different words to avoid confusion with
Pluribus).

<P>It's useful to break up a DObject's internal functionality into pieces
called 'Components' (Ingredients).&nbsp; The <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/CompositeDObject.html">CompositeDObject</A>
class provides the basic support for this.&nbsp; That is, all subclasses
of <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/CompositeDObject.html">CompositeDObject</A>
can inherit the basic behavior of being able to add/remove/use instances
of some subclass of BaseComponent.&nbsp; The ComponentDObject class also
handles the automatic message routing to these components, and allows the
components to easily messaging with their remote counterparts via the support
methods <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/CompositeDObject.html#sendToHomeComponent(java.lang.String, ec.dom.session.Closure)">sendToHomeComponent</A>,

DObject Subclass Text Chat Example</H3>
One example DObject subclass implements a trivial text chat program.&nbsp;
Simple, yet it works.&nbsp; It deals properly with partition (the hard
part).&nbsp; The source code to the 'MultipointTextChat' DObject subclass
is in the CVS source tree in ec/dom/tests/lilbuddies.

<P>All of this code is written, and has been through a first round of initial
testing.&nbsp; It works as specified <B>now, </B>but does need more complete
testing.&nbsp; If you are interested in looking at the (fully commented)
source see the links on the individual javadocs for each class (there is
a link to the source for almost all classes) or <A HREF="dobjects/dom.zip">download
this zip</A>, or check out the code in the ec/dom/tests or ec/dom/tests/lilbuddies
subtrees.  There are Cafe project files for these two subtree located in ec5/projects/ec/dom/tests
and ec5/projects/ec/dom/tests/lilbuddies respectively.

Relevant Links</H3>
<A HREF="http://research.ivv.nasa.gov/RMP/links.html">Reliable Multicast</A>
(useful for definitions of reliability in the multipoint messaging case,
formal descriptions of distributed consensus, etc.).

<P>
<HR SIZE=14 WIDTH="100%">
<BR><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT></SUP> What is multipoint reliability?&nbsp;
First some terminology:&nbsp; A distributed system is composed of a finite
set S = { p<SUB>1</SUB>, ..., p<SUB>n</SUB>} of processes completely connected
through a set of channels.&nbsp; Communication is by message passing, and
asynchronous (there is no bound on the transmission delays).

<P><B>Definition of reliability in multipoint messaging</B>:&nbsp; A 'reliable'
channel ensures that a message sent by p<SUB>i</SUB> to p<SUB>j</SUB> is
eventually received by p<SUB>j </SUB>if p<SUB>i</SUB> and p<SUB>j</SUB>
are correct (i.e. do not crash).&nbsp; This does not exclude link failures,
if we require that any link failure is eventually repaired (physical 'link
failure' is usually modelled by equating it with process crash from the
point of view of the distributed system).&nbsp; A reliable channel can
be implemented by retransmitting lost or corrupt messages.

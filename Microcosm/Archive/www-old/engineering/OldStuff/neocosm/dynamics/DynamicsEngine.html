Dynamics Engine Overview</H2>

The DynamicsEngine is an overloaded term; it refers both to the media subsystem and to a specific 
class (or instance of that class) within the subsystem.  I shall use the terms 'subsystem' and 
'DynamicsEngine object' to dissambiguate.
<P>
The DE subsystem is responsible for displaying graphical and audio representations of in-world 
una.  It enforces no particular representational scheme - instead it uses a family of objects, 
Dynamos, which are written to manage different display formats, and which can be used concurrently.  
At present there are only two dynamos in use: Dynamo2D and Dynamo3D, which handle sprites and 
polygonal models respectively.  More dynamos could be written later if needed (for instance to 
deal with animated GIFs or sprite-handling specifically for card games etc...)
<P>
The DynamicsEngine object is mostly concerned with timing information - the Dynamos are responsible 
for managing their own animation, but they take a common time base from the DE object, which manages 
a list of objects that need to be run periodically.  The DE has its own thread, the DETickerThread, 
which activates the dynamos about 15 times a second, though this drops if the CPU is loaded (or if 
the DE is asked to run at a different rate).  Dynamos are intended to be able to deal with irregular 
ticking correcly.
<P>
The DE object also provides queuing for messages that could otherwise cause deadlock (notably 
forwarding EResults to an EObject inside the Vat).
<P>
The DE subsystem provides a texture caching service, available both to dynamos and to other GUI 
subsytems.  The texture cache has a 'soft' cache limit - the size of the cache grows from the 
originally specified size if new textures are requested but none are freed.
<P>
The DE subsystem deals with text balloon display.  The balloons are handled elsewhere in ucosm 
whilst they are still being typed, but when the user has finished composing the balloon (or if 
the message comes from a remote machine), the DE handles the rest.
<P>
The DE subsystem was written to run with AnyChannel renderer; the texture manager, the current 
dynamos and the swatch code are quite heavily tied to it (though they communicate with the rest 
of ucosm through interfaces which are AC independent). Other sections, such as the balloon 
system, the display heirachy system and the controller (of which more later) are only loosely 
tied to it.
<P>
The APIs that the DE implements are all based on a heirachical 3D coordinate system so that the 
interfaces should be fully general.  The DE manages the heirachical movement, rotation and 
containership operations, leaving dynamos free to work in their own local coordinate systems.

<H2>
The DynamicsQueue</H2>
The DyamicsQueue is a very simple callback mechanism.   DynamicsQueue.queue is called with three 
parameters: a reference to an object which implements the DynamicsCallback interface, and which 
will be called when the message is pulled off the queue, a data object and an integer id.  The 
DynamicsCallback object is usually, but not always, the same object that calls queue.  The data 
object is of type Object, but is frequently set to null for callbacks that need no state beyond 
the existance of the call itself.  The integer id is used by the DynamicsCallback object to 
switch upon if needed.   
<P>
Although the integer id's need not be any specific integer, it is best to use the DQ_FOO 
constants defined in DynamicQueue (which can be added to for new messages).  This allows 
for very readable tracing - the DynamicsQueue  Trace (trace-name 'dynamicsqueue'), gives 
the best overall impression of what the dynamics subsystem is doing, which is why it is 
mentioned in this overview document.
<P>
Use of the DynamicsQueue is the principle method of avoiding deadlocks; the queue is 
processed once per tick of the DETickerThread.  It is the first thing that happens in 
a tick cycle.

<H2>
The Controllers</H2>

The principle interfaces through which the una communicate with the DE subsystem are 
the Presenter interfaces (defined in the file cosm1/ui/presenter/UnumUIPresenter.java). 
These interfaces are implemented by the DEController objects, which are responsible for 
managing the heirachy of dynamos and for queuing calls into the dynamos so that they 
come from a single thread (in order to avoid deadlocks).
<P>
There are several controller classes:
<P>
<LI>DEControllerLeaf - this controller contains most of the code for the controllers: 
it deals with asynchronous loading of appearance files (which contain the dynamo-specific 
data for a particular representation - typically a list of bitmaps and sounds and the 
information used to string them together into animations) and hides this asynchrony from 
the una.  It caches dynamo state so that it can satisfy requests for such data as position, 
orientation, parent etc, without having to call the dynamo from the wrong thread.</LI>
<P>
<LI>DEControllerLeafNode - this class is a subclass of DEControllerLeaf.  It adds the 
ability to manage heirachical conmposition of child controllers (for instance the una 
might represent a table onto which things can be put).  This is done by manipulating 
the DisplayTree (see later) rather than by manipulating the dynamos, since the dynamos 
operate entirely in their own coordinate systems, and do not have any knowledge of each 
other.</LI>
<P>
<LI>DEControllerSlottedLeafNode - this class is a subclass of DEControllerLeafNode.  
It adds the ability to use 'slots' - named positions (which can change through animation, 
or according to state) for heirachical composition of child controllers (through the 
DisplayTree mechanism).</LI>
<P>
DEControllerSlottedLeafNode is the most commonly instantiated controller object.  
Originally it was intended that each unum would use the controller with the most 
limited abilities sufficient to represent that object.  It was easier, however, 
to use the composition-cabable controllers for all standard objects.  These three 
controller classes could be merged into one with no adverse affects.
<P>
<LI>DEAvatarController - this class is always used by avatars.  It has extra 
functionality for handling speech and identity.  It is a subclass of 
DEControllerSlottedLeafNode.</LI>
<P>
<LI>DEControllerRoot - this class is quite seperate from the rest of the controllers.  
It doesn't control and on-screen representation of an object, but rather manager the 
entire scene of objects.  It provides the sound-playing facilities for the region and 
it initiates region transitions.</LI>
<P>
Since these controller objects only pass calls down to dynamos via a queue, they all 
keep locals copies of various aspects of dynamo state, so that they can synchonously 
satisfy any requests from the una without needing to call into the dynamos.

<H2>
The Display Tree</H2>

The DisplayTree is a compositional heirachy designed to insulate the dynamos from each 
other.  The nodes of this tree each know their own position (in the coordinate space 
of their parent), and their parent's position  (in absolute coordinate space).  When 
a node is moved in space, the changed state is pushed downwards.
<P>
In effect, each dynamo keeps track only of where it should be in its own local space, 
with child DisplayTree objects being moved automatically.  After all the dynamos have 
been updated, any leaves which have moved in that tick can be redrawn.  
<P>
As well as keeping track of the positions of polygons, the tree keeps track of the 
position of compositional slots.  In the diagram below, an avatar is standing in a 
region.  The avatar has three compositional slots: left hand, right hand and head.  
It also has a couple of polygons, which are the on-screen representation of the avatar.  
In the avatar's right hand is a table, which can also contain objects, but which is 
currently empty.  The table is represented on screen by a single polygon.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DisplayTree.gif" WIDTH=601 HEIGHT=294>
<P> 
The position of the avatar, in the root's coordinate system, is stored in the avatar 
node.  This corresponds, typically, to the point midway between the avatar's feet.  
Offset from this point are the hands and head.  The offsets of these are stored in 
the 3 child nodes, and are in the coordinate system of the avatar.  The 'right hand' 
node contains the table.  The offset of the table from the hand is in the hand's 
coordinate system.  In this case it is the same coordinate system as the rest of 
the avatar, since all are managed by the same dynamo.  This is not enforced, but 
is always the case.  
<P>
If the avatar walks, the avatar node and everything under it moves.  If the avatar 
raises its right hand, the right hand node, and everything under it, will move.
<P>
The table node probably refers to the base of the table (since that would seem a 
logical place for a table to be considered to be).  The 'table slot' node would 
refer to a position on top of the table, in the coordinate space of the table.  
This in turn could hold another object etc...
<P>
Since the whole tree pushes information downwards, there is no unecessary polling for information.
<P>
Another aspect of the nodes which the tree manages is heirachical rotation for 
front-facing polygons (sprites).  Since the camera viewing the scene may be moved, 
the re-orientation of polygons that need to face the camera must be adjusted 
automatically.  If a 2D avatar is holding a 2D prop, then both polygons must be 
adjusted to face the camera by twisting them about a centre of rotation at the 
base of the avatar, so that an object in the avatar's hand will continue to look
 as though it is in the hand.
<P>
However, there is a subtlety caused by the face that 3D polygons do NOT need to 
be adjusted.  If a 3D avatar holds a prop, only the prop needs to rotate.  The 
DisplayTree keeps track of which sub-trees must rotate, and about which point 
it should be done.

<H2>
The Dynamos</H2>

Dynamos are responsible for managing the polygons that the renderer puts on the 
screen.  Their primary concern is animation.  They can be moved, oriented, and 
can perform named gesture (animations, sounds or both).  
<P>
Dynamos are 'ticked' by the DynamicsEngine, ususally at about 15 frames per second.  
They work out if they need to change any state in the renderer because of animations.  
Since the frame rate can be irregular (according to CPU loading), each dynamo is 
expected to make adjustments for it (by dropping frames of animation, interpolating 
between keyframes, or whatever is appropriate for that style of dynamo).
<P>
Dynamos can also return a bounding box of there representation so that it can be used 
by path-planning, should that get plugged into the region unum.

<H2>
Appearance Classes</H2>

Each dynamo type (Dynamo2D and Dynamo3D) has an appearance class associated with it.  
An appearance object is a data structure containing all the necessary information for 
display; typically this consists of lists of textures, sounds, VRML and other such data.  
Appearances are not expected to be opened up by any other object than the dynamo which 
deals with it, though they are passed around by una quite frequently.
<P>
Each appearance class inherits from Appearance, a super class which has a few methods 
common to all appearnces, such as getDataHolders(), which returns all the DataHolders 
(references to resources in the Repository) so that TOS checks can be made.
<P>
Each appearance class can take in a text file, parse it and turn it into an appearance 
object (if the text file is valid).  This ability is used by the curator to build repositories.

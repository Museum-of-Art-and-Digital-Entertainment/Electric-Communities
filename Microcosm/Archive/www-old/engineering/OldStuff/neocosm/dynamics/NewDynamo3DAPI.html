<H2>Overview</H2>
This, so far, is the first pass at defining an API for the new 3D code. I generated the following
by seriously hacking Kirk's aglib.h, both trimming and prettifying. It's gone from 1024 lines to
340 lines! This doesn't address the Dynamo interface-- I'm presuming that the Dynamo interfaces
will stay the same, and that we'll just be changing and improving the implementation. In particular,
I've heard several reports that Kirk's interface between Dynamo3D.java and Dynamo3D.cpp is really
nasty and leaves lots of room for optimization and simplification.
<P>
So what's below is a first crack at extracting what's necessary from aglib. All comments are welcome.
I renamed most prefixes from 'ag' to 'ec.' I haven't yet attempted to make sure all names are 
consistent.

The animation structures need the most work. The mesh stuff looks fairly straightforward.

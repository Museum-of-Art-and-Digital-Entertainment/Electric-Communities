Introduction</H2>
Below is a list of attributes to consider in assessing a piece of software.
Many of the attributes are relevant for assessing the quality of any software
(whether produced outside our company or not), but the list is intended
to be used specifically for assessing software that we have not written,
and are contemplating using for our own development. If choices are made
carefully, there are some great gains to be made by using to the maximum
the work that has/is/will be done by other people (e.g. no development,
off-loaded support, off-loaded upgrade, more focussed added-value for the
company’s output, etc., etc.). This document is an attempt to provide some
help in making careful choices. I don’t think this should be considered
a cure-all, however, as it will still be necessary to jointly and carefully
consider what external software to use.

<P>I’ve organized the list into several high-level categories: 1) Quality
of API; 2) Compatibility; 3) Competitive Alternatives; 4) Future of API;
5) Licensing. Please let me know if you have other items that should be
considered that I’ve missed.

<P>I think it would be appropriate to make this list into a simple matrix,
such that someone comparing competing APIs could directly rate each API
on each of these items, and possibly sum up the results to assess the overall
competitive environment. It would also be useful, I think, to allow manipulating
the weights of each of the characteristics listed below, so that the importance
of the relative criteria can be easily changed as appropriate. I will generate
such a matrix in Excel as soon as possible. I'll put a link to the spreadsheet
here when it is finished.
<H2>
Draft Attributes for Assessing APIs</H2>

<H3>
Quality of API</H3>
In general this is just the technical quality of the software under consideration.
Here are some suggestions of the attributes to consider when judging the
quality of a piece of software:
<UL>
<LI>
Judge clarity/simplicity of API</LI>

<LI>
Assess architectural soundness</LI>

<LI>
Assess runtime size</LI>

<LI>
Assess runtime speed</LI>

<LI>
Assess quality and extent of documentation</LI>

<LI>
Assess support</LI>

<LI>
Examine known bugs (any killers?)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Compatibility</H3>
It is critical that whatever software we consider using is compatible with
what we are doing. More specifically, here are some areas of compatibility
to consider:
<UL>
<LI>
Compatibility with our approach(es)</LI>

<LI>
Compatibility with our future plans</LI>

<LI>
Compatibility with the rest of our code</LI>

<LI>
Compatibility with our development environment</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Competitive Alternatives</H3>
Before selecting the use of a particular API, it is important that we assess
what the alternatives are, or are likely to be in the future. Here are
some suggested questions to ask, and activities to determine what alternatives
exist
<UL>
<LI>
Does EC, Onlive, TPI implementation already exist?</LI>

<LI>
Gather external public reviews of API</LI>

<LI>
Assess degree of use of API by other parts of company (TPI, Onlive, others)</LI>

<LI>
Assess degree of use of API by other companies</LI>

<LI>
Assess likelihood of marketplace success relative to alternatives</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Future of API</H3>
Although always speculation, it is important to think about what the likely
future of a given API is. For example, even if it is of the highest technical
quality, it will not be a good choice for use if it is made irrelevant
by another technology or another vendor of the same technology.
<UL>
<LI>
Determine turnover rate for new versions/releases</LI>

<LI>
Determine commitment to future development by vendor</LI>

<LI>
Determine whether API is a present/future standard? (i.e part of java core
api?, etc)</LI>

<LI>
Determine availability of source code</LI>

<LI>
Determine if future need exists for Onlive, TPI</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Licensing Structure</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Assess onetime costs</LI>

<LI>
Assess repeating costs</LI>

<LI>
Examine speed and ease of acquisition and use</LI>

<LI>
Assess corporate relations between EC and other company</LI>
</UL>

usage information, market information, etc).</H2>

<h2>Windows NT Task Manager</h2><p>
The Windows NT Task Manager is accesible by typing 'taskmgr' on a command line (it lives in \WINNT\system32\), right-clicking on the task bar and selecting the 'Task Manager' menu entry, or by hitting CTRL-ALT-DEL and then the Task Manager button. The three most useful columns (you may have to enable them via the 'View/Select Columns...' menu) to look at are:
<pre>
    Mem Usage  - the Working Set
    VM Size    - the total amount of memory RESERVED (but not necessarily COMMITTED)
    Threads    - the number of threads
</pre>

<h2><A HREF="http://www.optimizeit.com/">OptimizeIt</A></h2><p>
OptimizeIt is a JVM inspector. It reports on things like instance allocations,
the contents of objects, who references who, etc, and has some timing ability
(when last we looked, the timing accuracy was iffy). It's fairly painless to use -
you just run cosm inside of it, or run cosm with a special class and attach
to it, and it's GUI lets you explore your objects. It's very handy for 
figuring out how many objects a given action instantiates, and it has some
profiling ability as well.<p>


You can find OptimizeIt 2.01 Professional on a Unix box in /home/eng/win32/OptimizeIt/,
or via <A HREF="file:\\alexandria\eng\win32\OptimizeIt\\OptIt201P.exe">this link.</A> 
We have two licenses for it. The serial numbers are 970884 and 970885.

<A HREF="tools\OptimizeIt.html">Here</A> are detailed instructions on how to
install and run OptimizeIt 2.01 Professional.



<h2><A HREF="http://developer.intel.com/design/perftool/vtune/">VTune</A></h2> <p>
VTune is a low level profiler. It will tell you things like the amount of 
time you spent in given function or system call. VTune told us things like
how long the JVM spent doing the native part of Class.forName().  It's a little more painful to use and a bit more prone to crashing, but still an
excellent tool.
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/tools/vtune_of_habitat.txt">Here's</A> info from Wayne on the overall status of VTune as of 4/30/98, and how to use it to profile Cosm.

Here's</A> a link to Wayne's
original email instructions on how to use VTune to profile Cosm.

<pre>
VTune3.0 is currently (as of 6/23/98) in Beta 5. I'll try to download
this shortly.

<h2><A HREF="http://www.klg.com/jprobe/">JProbe</A></h2><p>
JProbe looks like a cross between VTune and OptimizeIt. It boasts
extremely accurate timers, and memory analysis tools. It's still not
clear if it'll give timings per thread, though. <br>

<h2><A HREF="http://www.kai.com/assurej/_index.html">Assure</A> (thread debugger)</h2> <p>
From their web page: <i>Assure is a new tool that finds data
                       race conditions, deadlocks and stalls
                       in multithreaded Java programs. </i>
Finding potential deadlocks early on, and ideally in some automated way
would be a wonderful thing, given our past experiences. This tool needs
more investigation. Customer service was very responsive to my question
about versions.

<h2><A HREF="http://www.preemptive.com/DashO/">DashO</A> (bytecode size reducer/optimizer)</h2> <p>
DashO claims to reduce the size of your bytecode by obfuscation of
method and class signatures and by <b>removing uncalled classes,
methods, and fields</b>! (they claim to be aware of dynamically loaded
classes). They also claim to optimize the resulting smaller bytecode
for further performance gains. This is definitely worth a look.

<h2><A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/tools/windows/ClampedMemory.html"> Artificially limiting memory on 95 or NT</a> </h2><p>
This is Tony's excellent note on how to make your OS think it has less
physical memory than it actually does. Very useful for testing performance
characteristics under different amounts of RAM. Of course, in the end,
run the test for real.<p>

<h5>
Don't forget to look at 
<A HREF=yestercosm/YesterCosm.html>YesterCosm's performance pages</a> for more thoughts and all the data we have on what went wrong.

<ul>
<li><bold>Class bloat.</bold> This impacts startup (class loading), and we got nailed with the 1.x JVM's penchant for paging in all the classes during a GC.
<li>Instance bloat. We had more Strings than you could shake 9K sticks at. In general, I think we were keeping way more stuff around than was necessary. The default Hashtable size is 101 (leading to 101 HastableEntries),set a smaller one if you don't need them, etc. (OptimizeIt helps greatly here)
<li>JVM memory allocation. Setting a minimum size of java heap helped us stop the continuous allocation problem we had.
<li>Object leaks. We held on to objects that we no longer needed. (OptimizeIt helps greatly here)
<li>Threads. Threads aren't that big (if you don't set the stack sizes way up), but they are expensive to create. Don't create them in a tight loop.
<li>Bytes over the wire. During transitions, we were inadvertantly sending WAY too much stuff over the wire. 10K is ~3 seconds 28.8kbaud. We were sending
on the order of 150K early on. (found by having diagnostics in our comm code, something we need to make sure exists again)
<li>Round trips. Earlier versions of the containership protocol had more round trips than were necessary. A round trip means that you're stopped, waiting on a response from the other side. (found by RobJ's brain, after looking at some comm system diagnostics)
<li>Switching JDK versions. There's generally a presumption that things will improve, but as 1.2 is proving, getting better doesn't necessarily mean faster, and certainly not smaller.
<li>Infrequent profiling. We gained nearly all of our perfomance in a very short period of time. As soon as we started tracking the performance, we were able to measurably improve it. Let's test early and often.
<li>Test on target platform. Make sure we test using target platform level machines. This probably isn't so dangerous perfomance-wise now, since we'd have to all go buy faster, better stacked machines now. Do I hear $0.50/meg, anyone?
<li>Identifying target performance. To say something is running slow or fast presumes that there is an expected goal. At one point, we had a page of performance goals (from Randy, Ellen, or DaveL as I recall). Even though the target numbers might be arbitrary, they give us something to shoot for, and help us prioiritize: this subsystem is 500% slow, but this one is only 120% slow, e.g.
<li>Native boundary crossings. Be careful of the overhead in repeatedly calling down to native code.
<li>Object destruction. Ensure that objects get destroyed when they're supposed to. This has been a source of wasted memory for us in the past.
</ul>

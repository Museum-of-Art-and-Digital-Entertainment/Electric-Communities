<I>Link to running EC5 added by Bill 6/16/98</I>

and many others.&nbsp; This is a currently-underdeveloped index to all
of the Neocosm pages.
<H2>
General Neocosm information</H2>

<OL>
<LI>
The <A HREF="neoarch/ArchitectureOverview.html">architectural overview</A>
is the place to learn about how all of Microcosm fits together.</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="Milestones.html">milestone list</A> is a hot contender for
Most Agitated Page :-)&nbsp; Check it out and squawk loudly if it looks
demented to you!</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="CosmSurvey.html">subsystem survey</A> is one of the best places
to start learning about the individual pieces of Microcosm.&nbsp; (and
it'll be getting much better pretty quickly.)</LI>

<LI>
The <A HREF="WorryList.html">worry list</A> is a worthwhile place to investigate
and to keep up to date.&nbsp; All contributions solicited!</LI>

<LI>
Check out our new <A HREF="CheckinProcedures.html">checkin procedures</A>
for all our in-progress not-fully-working code.</LI>

<LI>
And don't miss the <A HREF="CustomerRequirements.html">customer requirements</A>
page that JohnS will be fleshing out, or the <A HREF="ExternalDates.htm">external
dates</A> page describing what Christmas 1999 really means.</LI>

<LI>
After much (well, some) consideration, the results of the <A HREF="IDESelection.html">IDE
Selection</A> process are in.</LI>

<LI>
There is also some information on <A HREF="idefiles/RunningEC5Cafe.html">Running
EC5 in Cafe</A> available.</LI>

<LI>
Don't forget the <A HREF="ExceptionHandling.html">exception handling policy
document</A>.</LI>

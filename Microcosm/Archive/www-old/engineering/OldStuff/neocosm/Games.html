<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This is a set of board games. They all perform in the same manner.
The intention is that they be objects in catalogs, but currently,
they only exist in Randynet. Currently, the games include Chess,
Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), Makrook (Thai Chess), Tishai (Cheapass
Chess), Reversi (Othello), Gess (Go Chess),Threeple, Dots and Boxes,
Mancala.

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<H4>Current Architecture Overview</H4>

<P>The games are intended for informal play. The host mediates the
game. Players submit moves to the host for propogation to the players
and spectators. Moves are validated at every step. 

<P>The games require a dynamic display. The current system deals very
poorly with dynamic appearance. The options were to make every game
piece a separate unum, or to make every square on the game board a
swatchable. The first option is flexible, but extremely expensive.
The second option is clumsy. We chose the second option.

<P>The state of the game is kept in the state bundle. The state
includes a lot of implementation-specific detail about the
implementation of the game mediation ingredient.

<H4><A NAME="Proposed Architecture Overview"></A>Proposed
Architecture Overview</H4>

<P>Replace most of the state bundle with a game journal (a record of
all of the moves played thus far). This will make the state bundle
simpler and implementation independent. It will make it possible to
rewind a game, making it possible to examine a game or take back
moves. It will allow people coming into the game late to have an
option to see everything that has happened so far. It will make it
possible to save a game and resume it later. It will make it possible
for the surviving player in a disconnect to petition the Game
Federation  to award a win based on the journal.

<P>Design special game sets for tournament play. Capabilities to play
are given to specific players.

<P>Issue certificates at the conclusion of games, which can be
submitted to the Game Federation to determine rankings.

<P>The games should be made catalogable. This involves correcting the
relationship of pixel perfect objects with 3D regions and object
creation.

<P>The swatching method should be replaced with an animation system.

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>

<P>There is a wealth of games out there, but they cannot be used in
the Cosm system. Most simple games can be scripting languages.
Because we don't have a scripting language, games must be implemented
as ingredients.

<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>

<P>None.

<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>

<P>The ingredients are JavaDoc'd. Chess, Reversi, and Threeple are
completely Doc'd. The other ingredients refer to those.

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P>The games are examples. On of the goals was to make objects which
were not planned for which are similar to things that customers might
want to write for themselves. (Conclusion: It is too hard.)

<H4>Testing and Debugging</H4>

<P>The games were very useful in revealing bugs in swatching. The games
swatch hundreds of times more often than any other unums.

<H4>Resolved Issues</H4>

<H2>Extensibility Overview</H2>

We've had lots of talks about ways in which we could a llow the users of our software
to extend the product.

<H3>Extensibility terminology</H3>

<H4>Extensibility vs. Customization</H4>
We've often made a distinction between customization and extensibilty,
where the first is what you're allowed to change via in-world
mechanisms (choose from the variety of features we supply) and the second is more
like authoring, where the user is not just exploring permutations, but actually
adding new content (and potentially new behavior) to the world.

<H4>Appearance vs. Behavior</H4>
In EC parlance, Appearance refers to the visual manifestation of an
object. Despite the confusion with the strict definition of the word, things like
gestures and animations are not considered behavior, but fall underneath the appearance
umbrella.
<P>Behavior, in our realm, has always referred to <I>code</I> differences between
objects. In our current model, objects that have different behavior are different una.
Scripting language support would land squarely in the behavioral domain.

<H3>Production Tools</H3>
One obvious way to allow users to extend the world is with production tools. These
would provide the means for importing all kinds of media, enabling users to create
their own objects, avatars, and worlds.

<H3>Scripting language</H3>
Another way to allow extensibility is to offer a scripting language. This would
allow users to change the behavior of an object. Not just its appearance. For
examples of things that could be done with a scripting language, see
<A HREF="http:e/e-world-scripting.html">
E World Scripting Examples</A>.

<H3>A hybrid approach</H3>
Another idea that's been discussed is to provide a simple event model (objects
can know when certain world events have occured, and allow users to select from
a hard-wired set of behaviors. E.g., when any avatar picks up this object, play this
sound. Or, when any avatar enters the region, say "Hello!" in a word balloon.

<H3>User-oriented presentation ideas from Randy</H3>

<P>{I'm focusing on presentation related extensibility, not event related...} (in no particular order)

<P>A user might want to...

<LI>Import an arbitrary bitmap as an object (a photo of my pet cat attached to a Helper)</LI>
<LI>Use a different supplied image for an object (make a Rock-shaped chair)</LI>
<LI>Make an animating object (on/off light, open/close container, kinetic sculpture)</LI>
<LI>Import my current web page GIF movies (kinetic)</LI>
<LI>Create my own moodable images (mood ring)</LI>
<LI>Import/assign my own sounds to object/avatar gestures (MY laugh/greeting)</LI>
<LI>Construct a region out of supplied and custom parts</LI>
<LI>Change the geometry of walls/floors/whatever (esp. endpoints for floors/walls)</LI>
<LI>Import arbitrary VRML geometry, image masks, and intensity maps (New 3D thing)</LI>
<LI>Reassign/combine animations/gestures</LI>
<LI>Author/import animations/gestures (3D)</LI>
<LI>Author animations/gestures from frames (2D)</LI>
<LI>Create a 2D orientable appearance from images</LI>
<LI>Create custom commands for objects (Map 'change state' to 'King me!')</LI>


<H3>More ideas from Scott</H3>

<P>Here are some Monday morning musings about what customizations I would
guess people would find most attractive.  I've tried to list just a couple
(to get started) of the most obvious kinds of extensibility features first
from a purely 'implementationless' point of view, and then identify some of
the technical issues that would result from different approaches to
providing that capability.  Hopefully, this will stimulate folks to
generate other kinds of application-level extensibility features (because
I've just picked three pretty obvious ones).

<H4>Easily/quickly customize the way your avatar appears to yourself others</H4>


<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>How your 'face' looks</LI>
<LI>How your 'body' looks</LI>
<LI>How you move (i.e. gestures, walking, other movements associated with avatar)</LI>
<LI>What sounds you make</LI></OL>


<P>Some technical requirements for these features:

<P>For a and b, the levels of customization basically are dependent upon
*when you can make changes* to the way you look, and *how much flexibility*
you have in doing it.  For example, for 'when' the answer could range from
compile time (*we* define how everyone looks when the system is compiled...
i.e. no flexibility), to off-line...(an appearance editor outside of MC),
to an appearance editor *of some undefined functionality* within the
virtual space.  For the 'how' it could be via a palette of available
bodies and faces (what we have now), and it could be the importation of an
arbitrary bitmap...it could even be a bitmap editor within the context of
the space itself (make new looks online).  The use of arbitary bitmaps is
much more general/desireable, but requires dealing with the issue of
needing to asynchronously download something...and the attendant problem
of the need for a global namespace for referencing these graphic objects,
and then caching them/storing them persistently/keeping them up-to-date, etc).

<P>Note that the 'when' and 'how' can be mixed and matched as appropriate...
i.e. the answer to 'when' could be: online (which we already have); and the
answer to 'how' could be: arbitrary .jpgs available through a web server
(ours or whatever).

<P>For animation of the avatar, I think the 'when' and 'how' questions also
apply very well.  So, for example, for 'when' we could say: when the
appearance file is created (before display); and for 'how' we could say:
<P>via an off-line appearance file editor (that just reads in/manipulates/spits out
appearance files).  This isn't the extreme on 'when' and 'how'...for example,
'when' could be online (real time), and how could be an 'animation scripting
language', but the technical and design requirements for an approach like
this are harder, because they require things like a) a scripting language
or GUI simple enough to fit the bill (and probably tailored specifically
for defining sequences of animations to make it easy); and b) require
some way to support a scripting language in the distributed system... i.e.
be able to introduce new avatar behavior (script) in real-time to all the
places where it's needed (all machines where avatar is being displayed).

<H4>Easily/quickly customize how your 'objects' look</H4>
<P>Basically, this is the same as above, except that now we're talking
about all una, rather than just avatars.  It  warrants a separate item,
however, because I think it is much less important as a user-level feature
than customizing avatars, and if that point wasn't made clear it would be
easy to try to produce the same level/kind/UI for customizability for
everything (e.g. property sheets).  I think having the same access to
customizability for everything (including avatars) would be a bad idea,
because customizing the look/sound/animation of objects in the room is
so much less important, I think, than being able to customize one's
own appearance to others.

<P>Note that the first two items above do *not* have any *inter-una*
messaging.  That is, they don't define any interactions between una,
rather they just allow for flexibility of how an unum (avatar or anything
else) presents itself visually/aurally...and in terms of how it animates
itself or presents sounds.  This is a nice characteristic of appearance,
gestures, animations, sounds...essentially media associated with una...
it doesn't necessarily require that una interact with one another (it
might be triggered just by time passing, or user input).  The next item,
however, is flexibility that requires interaction between una.

<H4>Define new ways for my avatar to interact with other avatars in the virtual space</H4>

Examples:
<LI>When Ellen's avatar arrives, my avatar automatically waves at her
(graphically or textually).</LI>
<LI>When someone whispers to me with the 'magic word' my avatar jumps up and down.</LI>
<LI>My avatar can do 'Eliza'-like filtering of text chat</LI>
<LI>I can introduce a new chess game object so you and I can play chess together </LI>
etc., etc...this is very large category!</LI>

<P>Some technical requirements:  IMHO, the hard part about these kinds
of interactions between una is having a technical infrastructure that
allows the 'when' to be online, and the 'how' to be with a large variety
of interfaces that are *appropriate to the behavior being defined* (and,
of course, to provide security).  In general, this is a *very* big
category of behavior extensibility, and I think it makes sense to
look at each item we identify as important within this category and
ask:  *when* should the user be able to modify this behavior (e.g.
compile time, off-line, start-time, run-time), and how do we want
them to be able to modify it (e.g. write real code, write scripts
off-line, provide scripts at start time, provide scripts at run time,
actually create full functionality scripts at run time).  I think that
as we identify these important interactions, we need to think about
the when and how each might be provided and keep in mind that it could
be different for every one (doesn't have to, but it might be).  This
will keep us from falling into the trap of over-generalization... the
tendency to only look at the *hardest* and most general 'when' and
'how' for providing new inter-una interactions.

<H3>More ideas from Tony</H3>

<P>Some of these may not fall neatly into the two camps we've discussed
so far: the Event/Action script camp or the PresentationToPropertySheet camp.

<P>It seems like one of the goals of this team is to evaluate whether we can
afford to implement these kinds of things.

<H4>Macros</H4>
For text and for gestures. This would be *huge*

<H4>Alternative gestures</H4>
Access gestures other than the fixed set on the button bar. I can imagine a dialog:

<CODE><PRE>
Gesture button : [Wave           V] (pulldown of gesture buttons)
Gesture        : [FranticWave    V] (pulldown of available gestures)
Gesture name   : Tony's Wave        (user-defined name for console-mode)
Shortcut       : [ctrl-t]           (user-defined shortcuts)
</PRE></CODE>

<H4>User-defined keyboard shortcuts</H4>
WorldsAway uses Function keys for gestures, we've got ours mapped mnemonically.
What if people don't like our mapping?

<H4>More keyboard shortcuts</H4>
OpenPocket, TeleportHome, others...

<H4>Choosing default gestures</H4>
We will have more gestures than avatars by the time we ship.
The nature of our 3D avatars is that we design a gesture once
and then all the avatars could use it. We'll have a dozen "stand"
poses, and hopefully several different walk styles. It would be
great if the user could choose their own gesture for each of these.

<H4>Changing the looping status of gestures</H4>
<P>Gestures can play a fixed number of times or they can loop
indefinitely. If users had access to this loop count, they could
change the loopiness of their gesture.

<H4>Change the sound for a gesture</H4>
I'm not sure how users would refer to the sounds, though.
Seems to call for a "sound swatch." Could be off-topic. :-)

<H3>Even more comments from Tony</H3>

<H4>Bang, buck, ease-of-use</H4>
There's no way we can provide access to all of this.
There's too much stuff. Even if we could, we'd probably
choose not to because it would be overwhelming to the user.
So I think our goal is to choose what extensibilty we can
provide very carefully.

<H4>Making Appearance data available for modification</H4>
As I understand things, all the items that are on property
sheets come from unum state. Randy's done a terrific job of
keeping the distinction between Appearance data and Unum data
clear in his list. Why is it relevant? Appearance objects
are stored in the Repository. As such, they must be static.
We don't want users to modify them directly, because the
objects can't change. If we want users to edit the information
inside the Appearance objects, we have to move the information
inside the unum, so that it can be checkpointed, and persist.
The bottom line. Anything in Appearance data that we want the
users to be able to change has to be stored in the unum so that
it can override the defaults that exist in the Appearance. This
makes the Appearance much more like a template, which I believe
was the original goal.

<P>I believe this is how swatches currently work-- the Appearance
file has default colors that are applied to the costume, but swatch
operations override them. I've never seen this persist however,
even across a region transition, so I'm guessing there's still
some work to do here.

<H4>Where's the work?</H4>
I want to know how hard these steps are:

<LI>Storing Appearance information in the unum. Is there a way to
do this flexibly, so that we don't store a bunch of empty fields
for una that aren't overriding the appearance files?</LI>

<LI>Updating the Appearance object, when necessary. When the user
changes the number of loops in a gesture, she is changing the
loopCount in the unum. This way, when the object is checkpointed,
that piece of state persists. However, the loopCount also needs
be copied to the Appearance object so that the loop behavior works
as expected.</LI>

<LI>Wiring Property sheet UI to a piece of unum state. As with many
things in our system, I can describe very simply how something ought
to work: The user chooses his default walk gesture from a pulldown
list of available gestures. Things tend to be harder to implement
than they are to describe. How hard is the "plumbing" for this?</LI>

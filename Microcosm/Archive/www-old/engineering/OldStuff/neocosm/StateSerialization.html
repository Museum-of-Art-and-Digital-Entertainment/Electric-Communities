Introduction</H2>
State serialization involves a number of support classes for helping the
developer to save only the core semantic state of the application. Saving
the core state minimizes the number of classes that need to be made serializable
and upgradeable.

<P>There are three levels for the support, the lowest one is a serialization
stream based on Java serialization, then there is E Runtime support for
the core classes and finally in the Pluribus runtime there is support for
saving the una and the relationships between them.

Requirements</H2>

<H4>
Java Serialization Stream</H4>
The requirements for the serialization stream are:
<UL>
<LI>
Simple interface for usage (of the form writeObject/readObject).</LI>

<LI>
Simple interface for defining programatically define how and what of an
object is saved and read in (allowing objects to define their own writeObject/readObject
methods).</LI>

<LI>
Explicit means of declaring which classes are serializable.</LI>

<LI>
Tools for establishing stream based policy for replacement of objects in
the serialization stream (although this is something that can also be done
with specialized encoding behaviors).</LI>

<LI>
Policy and mechanism for dealing with different upgrade scenarios.</LI>
</UL>
Java serialization met all of these requirements, performance has not been
measured yet though, and there might be other issues, there have also been
upgrades to it from the version we are using.
<H4>
E Runtime Support</H4>
Support was needed for the following core classes:
<UL>
<LI>
Registrar.</LI>

<LI>
SturdyRefs.</LI>

<LI>
RtTethers, in particular EUniChannels.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
Pluribus Runtime and Una</H4>
There were three basic requirements for saving the una, one of them as
we move into the future is not applicable:
<UL>
<LI>
Base serializable state bundle class. The state bundles are the objects
used to initialize the ingredients that make up an unum.</LI>

<LI>
Saving the inter-unum relationships without having to save the entire unum
and its facets.</LI>

<LI>
Preserving current interfaces that passed live strongly typed object references
to establish inter-unum relationships. (this requirement is not as strong
as we move forward)</LI>
</UL>

Architecture</H2>
<I>Diagrams are strongly encouraged; a few diagrams can do wonders for
clairifying an architecture. If you don't know how to add diagrams consult

Introduction</H4>
Our initial approach to persistence for MicroCosm was orthogonal persistence.
Orthogonal persistence consists of establishing a boundary within a process
(what we called a vat) and then saving everything within that boundary,
including ongoing computation. This ‘save everything’ approach had several
disadvantages:
<UL>
<LI>
Every single object within the boundary was saved, resulting in large save
files and slow checkpointing times.</LI>

<LI>
Since all of the objects and computation were getting saved, any running
bugs were also saved, any object leaks got preserved.</LI>

<LI>
Upgrade was very difficult since if you wanted to change a single class
A you needed to change every single class and instance of object that referred
to A within the boundary. Any more ambitious changes were impossible.</LI>
</UL>
The basic problem is that we committed to save too much so we decided to
ask ‘What is the least amount of information we can save while maintaining
all meaningful state?’ Just enough information to initialize the object.

<P>In the case of the Registrar which has over 20 instance variables we
only needed to save the Private/Public key pair. For una we just need to
save, and maintain consistent the state bundles used at initialization.

<P>Saving the minimal amount of information possible (‘Principle of least
commitment’) makes upgrade much easier to manage. As I was testing startup
behavior I kept modifying classes like the Registrar while maintaining
the same save file because all it needed from it was the key pair, I could
have rewritten the entire class and the save file remains the same.

<P>When you serialize an object to disk you are committing for the foreseeable
future to maintain it, to upgrade it and to upgrade any objects that refer
to it. So it is very important that you evaluate carefully before you make
a class Serializable, to ask yourself the question ‘Am I ready to make
that kind of commitment?’

<P>For most objects we are just using plain Java serialization, the extra
support we needed to provide was:
<UL>
<LI>
E Runtime Java serialization support for Registrar, using SturdyRefs, publishing
SturdyRefs and serialization delegation support (allowing an object to
designate another to take its place in the stream).</LI>

<LI>
StateOutput and StateInput streams that implement our serialization policy.</LI>

<LI>
StateTimeMachine for save file management.</LI>

<LI>
Pluribus runtime support classes for serializing una: SoulState, jCapabilityGroup
and in particular capability recoupers for preserving inter-unum relationships.</LI>
</UL>

Making a class serializable</H3>

<DIV ALIGN=right><I>Do you, Programmer, take this Object to be part of

<DIV ALIGN=right><I>- Erm, can I get back to you on that?</I></DIV>


<P>When you are first choosing which objects are to be made Serializable
you need to carefully evaluate what you will be saving. When you make a
class Serializable you are committing to support:
<UL>
<LI>
The instance variables, including all of its types.</LI>

<LI>
The interface of that version of that class.</LI>
</UL>
A pattern that we’ve found useful in changing MicroCosm into an application
that is persisted using Serialization is to separate the state information
from the actually running object with its methods (saving the state bundles
vs. saving the ingredients) then use this state information to create a
new instance of the class at startup. If the object you save has no methods,
its one less thing to worry about and maintain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Questions to ask yourself as you are deciding whether to make a class serializable</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Do I really want to save this class?</B></LI>


<P>When implementing serialization for cosm I made the base state bundle
class Serializable, I walked through the code converting everything that
seemed straightforward. When I got to the presentation state in the containership
state bundle I found a class called DEStartupData, upon further examination
it turned that this class ended up referring to another 10 classes that
went all the way into the bottom of the system. It was a good time to stop
and evaluate whether I wanted to make that commitment to all of those classes,
after examining the code I realized that I could just save a little information
and reconstruct everything at startup.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Is the information to make this object saved elsewhere? If so is it
easier to save this instance or recreate the object at startup?</B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>It turned out that all of the presentation state support classes (including
DEStartupData) were instantiated from a String and a couple of other pieces
of information, so I just saved that in the bundle and at instantiation
time I recreated all of the objects. This way we could replace the Dynamics
Engine and the save file would remain the same. This kind of strategy can
also be leveraged for over the wire when trying to send the least amount
of information possible.</UL>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Does it make sense to split the state into a separate class used for
initialization and storage?</B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>Ingredients can be very complex objects with large interfaces and several
instance variables, saving such an object would be making a very large
commitment. Due to other reasons we already had such objects for MicroCosm.
State bundles are basically structs (Java object with mutable public instance
variables) that save all of the information needed to initialize an ingredient
in an unum. Using this to save all the state in MicroCosm has yielded small
save files as well as a clear target for maintenance. Making the object
to be saved a separate entity helps the programmer be very conscious about
deciding which information needs to be saved.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>What is the least amount of information possible that I could save?</B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>The Registrar has 20 or so instance variables, including many support
classes, as I analyzed its code it became clear that the only information
that needed to be saved was the Private/Public key pair, and that the rest
of the support objects got instantiated at startup based on that, so Eric
created a separate method called ‘<TT>init(KeyPair pair)</TT>’ that was
called both from the constructor and the readObject method that instantiated
all of the helper objects.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Should I provide custom serialization methods?</B></LI>


<P>If you tag a class as Serializable Java will save all of the instance
variables in it (except for the ones marked as transient). This automatic
behavior is convenient for some classes but for others like the Registrar
it makes sense to implement a writeObject and readObject methods to capture
any special behavior including instantiating helper objects, or getting
at any resources of the local session.

<P>I got bit when using this a couple of times because I got used to the
fact that most of my classes were being saved implicitly, so when I added
an instance variable to a class that had custom serialization methods I
got all sorts of null pointers because I didn’t add the mechanism to save
and read in that new instance variable.</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Should I use transient?</B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>Instance variables marked as transient are not saved, and their classes
do not need to be made Serializable. Be careful when using transient, anything
marked transient is not copied by the Java serialization and our own comm
system encoding. This bit me when developing because I made an instance
variable transient so that it would not be saved on disk when it turned
out that it needed to be sent over the wire.

<P>(Btw, it would be nice to have something much more flexible than transient
that depended on the Serializer being used, you can get some of this behavior
by implementing writeObject/readObject and then checking the instanceof
the serializer passed in).</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Are there any instance variables that may cause a NotSerializableException
depending on their value?</B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>Variables of type Object can cause a NotSerializableException exception
depending on their value, when possible make sure that all the variables
are strongly typed to Serializable classes.</UL>

<H3>
Once you’re sure, really sure that you want to save it</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
Tag the class with the java.io.Serializable interface.</LI>

<LI>
Write any custom serialization methods if applicable.</LI>

<LI>
Make a commitment and seal it with a SerialVersionUID</LI>
</OL>
The default Java serialization behavior is quite tolerant to changes, but
if you remove an instance variable, or method (See <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/userdoc/third_party/jdk1.1.3/docs/guide/serialization/spec/version.doc.html#6519">Versioning
of Serializable Objects</A>) you are going to get an InvalidClassException
exception when trying to deserialize. The way you let Java know you really
know what you are doing is by sealing the class with a final static variable
named SerialVersionUID.

<P>You get the value for that variable using a tool provided by JavaSoft,
when you run that tool in your class you are establishing what you’re committing
to maintain. Any future versions of the class that have the same SerialVersionUID
need to be able to support in read/write all of the variables and methods
of the version of the class for which you computed it.

<P>So when you’ve finished implementing and debugging your serializable
class, you commit to that version using this.

<P><I>Remember the principle of least commitment, the less you save, the
less you have to maintain.</I>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Other notes about Java Serialization</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
A class instantiated by deserialization will be completely empty.</LI>
</UL>
No constructors or inlined initializers will be called, then the non-transient
variables will be restored into it. If you implement writeObject and readObject
you need to either read in all the variables yourself, or call defaultWrite/ReadObject.
<UL>
<LI>
NotSerializableException is your friend.</LI>
</UL>
When testing your serialization code every time you get one of this exceptions
evaluate with care, before making that class serializable examine the chain
of referring objects, and examine what that class refers to. You’ll sometimes
find that you are saving a lot of stuff that you did not intend to save.
<UL>
<LI>
Making an application serializable</LI>
</UL>
A useful pattern when writing the test programs and then in MicroCosm was
to create a single Serializable object to hold onto all of the persistent
application state (know as the SuperBundle). You write your application
to start up and maintain the information in that object such that when
you want to save out, you just save out that object, and to start up, you
just read it in and you will have already written all of your init code
to start from that information.
<H2>
E runtime serialization support</H2>
These sections describe the classes in the E runtime that have serialization
support. The most important one for a networked E application is the Registrar
since it is the source of a process’ identity as well as a part of every
SturdyRef published by that process. SturdyRef support is divided between
the user of a SturdyRef and the publisher of a SturdyRef, finally there
is a brief note on writing serialization support for a networked E application.
<H3>
The Registrar and Process ID</H3>
In E your process’ identity is based on the Registrar’s key pair. Any SturdyRef
that you publish is a combination of that process’ identity and a swiss
number assigned to that object. So if you want to preserve process identity
and any SturdyRef that you published the first thing you need to do is
save the Registrar.

<P>Registrar is Serializable, but due to its unique role in an E system
it has special properties:
<UL>
<LI>
There can only be one Registrar.</LI>

<LI>
If there is no existing Registrar when reading an StateInputStream the
Registrar coming in from the stream will establish itself as the one and
true Registrar.</LI>

<LI>
If there is an existing Registrar the incoming Registrar will verify that
it has the same core information and then use the local one, if not it
will throw an IOException letting you know that you can’t have two different
Registrars.</LI>
</UL>
Due to the way MagicPowers instantiate objects it is advisable to have
the Registrar be the first object that you write and read from your application’s
save file.
<H3>
SturdyRefs publishing and using</H3>
There are two sides to preserving SturdyRefs, one is when you are a client
holding onto a SturdyRef and another is when you’re a publishers, holding
onto an RtForwardingSturdyRef.
<H4>
Using a SturdyRef</H4>
SturdyRefs are Serializable. The capability obtained from doing a followRef
should be stored on a transient variable and reestablished at init.

<P>If there is no existing Registrar when trying to read in a SturdyRef
an IOException will be thrown on decode.
<H4>
Publisher using RtForwardingSturdyRef</H4>
Usually you publish a SturdyRef the following way:

<P><TT>SturdyRef ref = myRegistrar.getSturdyRefMaker().makeSturdyRef(obj);</TT>

<P>That SturdyRef is the unique network identifier of that object, it is
a combination of the Registrar’s public key and a swiss number assigned
to that object. For Serialization we wanted to be able to keep the SturdyRef
(that other processes might be saving) without having to serialize the
object that it designates. This is the RtForwardingSturdyRef class.

<P>You create and publish RtForwardingSturdyRef the following way:

<P><TT>RtForwardingSturdyRef forwardingRef =</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myRegistrar.getSturdyRefMaker().makeForwardingSturdyRef(obj);</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SturdyRef ref = forwardingRef.getSturdyRef();</TT>

<P>The RtForwardingSturdyRef is a Serializable object that you can put
in your state bundle. At revival time you need to set a target for it using
setTarget. A target can only be set once. At revival the SturdyRef will
not be published until you set a target. (I could change this behavior
to set up and publish a Channel at decode to be forwarded once a target
is set). The RtForwardingSturdyRef will preserve the SturdyRef/Identity
while allowing you upgrade and evolve its target separately.

<P>For example, our identity infrastructure is based on a SturdyRef to
the identity ingredient. We wanted to be able to keep the SturdyRef/identity
without having to serialize the identity object. The state bundle for the
identity ingredient looks as follows:

<P><TT>public class istIdentity extends istBase {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public RtForwardingSturdyRef myIdentityForwardRef;</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT>

<P>And the the (abriged) init method for the identity ingredient looks
as follows:

<P><TT>init(istIdentity identityState) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; // Create identity</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; eIdentity identity = new eIdentity(myIdentityOwner);</TT>

<P><TT>&nbsp; if (null == identityState.myIdentityForwardRef) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // No pre-existing FowardingSturdyRef, make
new one.</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identityState.myIdentityForwardRef =</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myState.myRegistrar.getSturdyRefMaker().</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; makeForwardingSturdyRef(identity);</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } else {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Establish identity on existing
SturdyRef</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identityState.myIdentityForwardRef.setTarget(identity);</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } catch (Exception ex) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ethrow new eeException("Identity
ingredient not</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
initialized: Conflict"+ex);</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT>

<P>An RtForwardingSturdyRef depends on the Registrar information to preserve
the published SturdyRef’s identity, hence when you serialize a RtForwardingSturdyRef
instance you also serialize that process’ one true Registrar. At deserialization
the Registrar read in compares itself with an existing one and if the comparison
fails the deserialization fails since the SturdyRef can’t be preserved.
<H4>
Note on making a networked application serializable</H4>
Due to the importance of the Registrar to the system it is a good idea
to save and read in the process’ Registrar as the first thing in the Object
stream. This should be done as a separate step since if you make it the
first instance variable in your application’s bundle there is no guarantee
that it will be the first thing saved/read (as MikeS discovered with a
Duplicate Registrar bug).
<H2>
State bundles and saving una</H2>
An unum is a distributed object composed of instances of objects called
ingredients. An unum instance in a process is called a presence, the first
(prime) presence of an unum is also its host. An unum instance/host presence
is uniquely paired to the SoulState instance which is used to instantiate
it. A SoulState is a class that keeps all of the state bundles used to
instantiate the ingredients that make an unum’s host presence. For state
bundle persistence the SoulState is the unum’s representation in the Object
stream.

<P>A SoulState is uniquely paired to an Unum instance. A SoulState keeps
the state bundles used to initialize the host ingredients. It is these
bundles that are saved for persistence, your ingredient must keep and update
the state bundle given to it at initialization time.
<H3>
State bundles</H3>
State bundles are serializable struct like classes with a number of mutable
public variables and no methods beyond constructors. These objects are
used to initialize ingredients. Usually different ingredient implementations
of the same kind (einterface) share the same state bundle class. Their
class names are prefixed by ‘ist’.

<P><I>[98/05/18 Arturo added note on bundle/ingredient separation]</I>

<P>The benefits of separating the state bundle from its ingredient are:
<UL>
<LI>
You minimize the contract for upgrade, state bundles are very simple classes
with no methids, this gives you freedom to change the ingredient as much
as is necessary without worrying about its serialization issues.</LI>

<LI>
You may use a single state bundle with more than one ingredient, and leverage
the upgrade path there.</LI>

<LI>
You encapsulate the upgradeable information in a separate easier to maintain
class.</LI>
</UL>
The cost of separating state like this is the class bloat. <I>[End]</I>

<P>Example istDescription state bundle used to initialize the iiSimpleDescriber
and iiDescribeWithLink ingredients:

<P><TT>public class istDescriber extends istBase {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; /** A Unicode string representing the object description.
*/</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; public String theDescription;</TT>

<P><TT>&nbsp; /** a brief name, e.g. as used in labels */</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; public String theShortDescription;</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT>

<P>Any state that you want persisted needs to be reflected, and updated
in the state bundle used to instantiate the host ingredient. The instance
variables in the state bundle have to be one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Java primitive.</LI>

<LI>
Java Serializable class.</LI>

<LI>
Developer Serializable class.</LI>

<LI>
Registrar, SturdyRef or RtForwardingSturdyRef.</LI>

<LI>
For inter-unum relationships see <A HREF="#Inter-unum relationships and capability">capability
recoupers</A>.</LI>
</UL>
State bundles are also used to initialize client presences of an unum,
they are returned by the getClientState() function implemented by ingredients.

<P>Only return the host/initial state bundle if it contains non-mutable
data. Otherwise instantiate and return ‘client’ version of the state bundle
(usually the same class with less data).
<H3>
SoulState</H3>
The goal of the SoulState was to be able to save the least amount of information
possible about an unum while retaining all of its meaningful state. To
do this the
<BR>SoulState saves three pieces of information:
<OL>
<LI>
The unum’s class name.</LI>

<LI>
The state bundles used to instantiate it.</LI>

<LI>
The capability group of capabilities made available by that unum.</LI>
</OL>
This is intended to give a fair amount of flexibility when upgrading an
unum, no description of which ingredient classes, or how many are supposed
to make a presence is saved. The new version of the unum under that class
name only needs to be able to instantiate itself from that set of ingredients.

<P>The SoulState class serves a dual role:
<UL>
<LI>
It is used to initialize a new unum.</LI>
</UL>
The MCUnumFactory fills the SoulState with all the relevant state bundles.
Then createUnum is called providing that SoulState instance as an argument,
at that time that SoulState instance is bound to that unum instance.
<UL>
<LI>
The SoulState stores and saves the state bundles and the class name of
the unum.</LI>
</UL>
It is used to serialize and then reinitialize that unum. The only thing
saved of an unum is its SoulState which holds on to its initial state bundles,
at deserialization time the SoulState will create a new instance of that
unum class initializing it with the saved state bundles.

<P>A SoulState also has a unique jCapabilityGroup instance. A jCapabiltyGroup
is a hashtable used to export capabilities to that unum. It incorporates
mechanism to allow the exported capabilities to get reconstructed at startup
(see <A HREF="#Inter-unum relationships and capability">Inter-unum relationships
and capability recouping</A>).
<H4>
Decoding behavior and transient capabilities.</H4>
Usually SoulStates will instantiate their corresponding una at decode.
But there are certain special una that depend on special objects/capabilities
created at startup before being instantiated. The two cases of this are
the Realm and the Avatar.

<P>To support these objects, SoulState has a function called instantiateOnReadObject
that allows you control whether the unum is instantiate on decode:

<P><TT>myRealmSoulState = new SoulState();</TT>
<BR><TT>myRealmSoulState.instantiateOnReadObject(false);</TT>

<P>This way you can set any transient capabilities in the state bundle
of that SoulState at startup. When you’re done you call:

<P><TT>Unum myRealm = myRealmSoulState.makeUnum();</TT>

<P>Or <TT>createUnum</TT> using that SoulState.
<H2>
<A NAME="Inter-unum relationships and capability"></A>Inter-unum relationships
and capability recouping</H2>
Since the SoulState is the only thing that gets saved of an unum we needed
to establish a way to save inter-unum pointers without actually saving
the una or the ingredients. This led to the implementation of the capability
recouping pattern where intermediary objects are used to save the relationship
in terms of the SoulState while providing straightforward reconstruction
at startup.
<H4>
Assumptions</H4>
Right now only host presences are saved, and only inter-host relationships
are saved this way. Otherwise SturdyRefs are used. Inter unum capabilites
are expressed in terms of facets, which are strongly typed objects that
wrap the ingredients directly.
<H4>
Publishing a capability</H4>
At init time you use the unum’s jCapabilityGroup to establish the initial
recoupable capability:

<P><TT>init() {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; // I know this needs a more convenient get function...</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; environment.soul.getSoulState().getCapabilityGroup.</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; makeAndAddCapabilityOfType(target,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ec.cosm.objects.ukAddUnum$kind");</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT>

<P><TT>makeAndAddCapability</TT> of type will create a facet to the ingredient
that is reestablished after revival. The string is the name of the einterface
that the target object implements. An EStone of that type will be created.
At decode a EUniChannel of that type will be created while the real capability
is republished.

<P>To send that recoupable capability to another unum you need to get it
from the jCapabiltyGroup using:

<P><TT>kind ukAddUnum cap = (kind ukAddUnum) capabilityGroup.getCapabilityOfType("ec.cosm.objects.ukAddUnum$kind");</TT>
<BR><TT>myFriend &lt;- haveCapability(cap);</TT>

<P>We also use this to establish inter-object relationships in the MCUnumFactory,
in this case we have the factory fetch the capability from the group and
give it as an initialization parameters.
<H4>
Using, and saving a capability</H4>
You start by adding jRecoupableCapability instance variable to your state
bundle:

<P><TT>public class istContainable extends istBase {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; /** jRecoupableCapability for the container. */</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; jRecoupableCapability rcContainer;</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT>

<P>Upon receipt of the real capability store in the jRecoupableCapability
iv:

<P><TT>method haveCapability(kind ukAddUnum cap) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; myState.rcContainer.setCapability(cap);</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; myContainer = cap;</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT>

<P>At init (either initial or from revival, it is the same) get the capability
from the jRecoupableCapability:

<P><TT>init(istContainable state) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; if (null != state.rcContainer) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myContainer =</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (kind ukAddUnum)state.rcContainer.getCapability();</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; if (myContainer != null) {</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myContainer &lt;- addMe();</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp; }</TT>
<BR><TT>}</TT>

<P>The reason for passing the transient capabilities and using the intermediary
objects to reestablish the relationships was that this kind of serialization
was retrofitted to our existing code base. In a more sensible future the
object passed around as the capability should include all of the mechanisms
for establishing and recuperating.
<H2>
Low level Serialization support</H2>

<H3>
Design Objectives</H3>
To provide Object Output and Object Input streams that allows us to implement
the following serializing policies:
<UL>
<LI>
Proxies get written out as null.</LI>

<LI>
Objects can designate a delegate for serialization. This delegate will
replace the object in the output stream. This is used by Deflectors (to
Channels and other RtTethers) to defer serialization to the real objects
behind them.</LI>
</UL>
These tools are used to build the higher level mechanisms for dealing with
inter-unum relationships described later.
<H3>
StateOutputStream</H3>
extends <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/userdoc/third_party/jdk1.1.3/docs/api/java.io.ObjectInputStream.html#_top_">java.io.ObjectOutputStream</A>

<P>Implements and enforces the encoding policy as outlined above.
<H3>
StateInputStream</H3>
extends <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/userdoc/third_party/jdk1.1.3/docs/api/java.io.ObjectInputStream.html#_top_">java.io.ObjectInputStream</A>

<P>Adds support for deserializing Registrars and SturdyRefs, you need to
instantiate it with a valid EEnvironment at instantiation time.
<H3>
RtDelegateToSerialize</H3>
Implemented by an object that defers serialization to another object, this
interface needs to be used with care since it does not do any type checking
on the object replacement.

<P>Its principal use is in the RtDeflector base class, an RtDeflector is
a strongly typed stub generated by ecomp that turns invocations into an
generalized form (the ec.e.run.RtTether interface), EUniChannel and Proxy
instances usually have an RtDeflector instance in front providing the strong
typing. When writing out an object stream we are not interested in saving
(and hence comitting to) these intermediary objects so you need to establish
which object a RtDeflector instance will serialize in its place. This is
this is used internally by jCapabilityGroup and jRecoupableCapability.
<H3>
State Time Machine</H3>
The state time machine provides methods and mechanism for managing a save
file for an application. It is a subclass of TimeMachine, so it leverages
off of all of the existing mechanism for saving a temporary file, backup
and etc. Now, with the introduction of state bundles, when TimeMachine.summon(Eenvironment)
is called, a StateTimeMachine will be created and returned. This makes
it so that all existing code that uses the TimeMachine does not have to
be touched.

<P>The StateTimeMachine save provides a notification architecture to help
with serialization debugging, profiling, and ultimately this will be used
for a user ‘thermometer’ UI to indicate save/restore progress. This notification
is provided in the two classes: StateSerializer and StateUnserializer.
When a TimeMachine is told to save a running microcosm, a StateSerializer
instance is created, and it does the actual serialization of the state
bundles to the StateOutputStream. During serialization of the state bundles,
the StateOutputStream calls back on the StateSerializer before every object
is serialized. The method called on the StateSerializer is ‘objectToBeWritten’.
If spam is turned on by putting: "Trace_ec.e.serialstate.StateSerializer=debug"
in the props file, then spam that already exists in this method will be
produced for every object that is serialized. This is useful for debugging,
but use with caution as it will produce a lot of spam.

<P>For restore, the same thing is done with the StateUnserializer. To trace
on restore of state bundles objects, put "Trace_ec.e.serialstate.StateUnserializer=debug"
in the props file. Again, much spam will result, so please use with caution.
<H2>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H2>
State bundle serialization seems to have worked well, the change to do
now that legacy interfaces are not an issue is to remove the support for
managing live object references and move to explicit serializable references
(probably based on SturdyRefs or its descendent).
<H4>
Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
We used Java serialization at the core of the subsystem, if there is a
performance issue we should explore alternatives.
<H4>
Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
N/A
<H2>
Current implementation</H2>

<H4>
Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
ec4/javasrc/ec/e/serialstate - for the core serialization support
<BR>ec4/javasrc/ec/pl/runtime - for jCapabilityGroup, Capabilty recoupers
and istBase class.
<H4>
Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>
It is partially JavaDoc'ed, Arturo needs to finish the documentation and
make sure it makes sense.
<H4>
Examples</H4>
ToDo: Yes, but they're not cleaned up or checked in.
<H4>
Testing and Debugging</H4>
Not beyond runing cosm, should have standalone test.

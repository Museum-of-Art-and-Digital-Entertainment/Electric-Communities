<H2>IDE Selection</H2>
<p>After careful consideration of various Integrated Development Environments, the "official"
IDE for the purposes of checkin verification (build buddy-style) at Electric Communities will
be <EM>Symantec Cafe</EM>.
<p>The reasons for choosing <EM>Symantec Cafe</EM> over the other contenders include minimization of
decision energy given that a full evaluation of each and every candidate would take weeks and
that <EM>Symantec Cafe</EM> is the IDE of choice at our sister company, Onlive. Choosing <EM>Symantec Cafe</EM>
allows us the possibility of future compatibility with Onlive development efforts, and gives
us a stake in the ground from which to measure.
<p>Note however, that in order forestall religious fervor, no one is <B>required</B> to use
<EM>Symantec Cafe</EM> for their day-to-day development. In fact, we (RobJ and BobS) want to encourage
a diversity of development environments (any of the IDEs mentioned herein, emacs and Sun JDK,
you name it). It is our feeling that the more compilers that can wander over our codebase, the
more likely we are to catch stupid mistakes.
<p>The bottom line: until we find some reason to not use it, <EM>Symantec Cafe</EM> will be used to validate
any and all checkins into the (new?) source code tree for new development. For anything other than
that specific case, any and all tools are allowed (and encouraged). Should we find a fatal flaw in
<EM>Symantec Cafe</EM>, we will dump it like a hot potato -- at which point we will want (as an organization)
to have a body of experience with other development tools that will allow us to choose a better one.

<H3>Available, but untested</H3>
The following is a list of new IDEs or new versions of IDEs that have yet to be tested.
<P>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.inprise.com/jbuilder/">Borland JBuilder 2.0</A>. This latest
release from Borland has convenient support for supporting multiple versions of the
JDK (including 1.2). Also provides a nice-looking interface builder with full
JavaBean/JFC support.

<H3>A plethora of IDEs</H3>

<p>Fully half of the IDEs surveyed were eliminated early,. Two of them, IBM Visual Age and Sun's
Workshop for Java, because they were painfully slow (Visual Age took over five hours to <B>import</B>
the Cosm tree!) Cygnus' IDE, which would have easily integrated with our production automated
build environment, won't be Java-capable for another 6-9 months.
<p>Of the remainder, nothing stands out after preliminary investigation. All of them provide
solid development environments with several generations behind them. All of them are optimized to
support development efforts smaller than ours (all of them use at least 128MB of virtual memory to
attempt to compile the pure Java version of cosm). J++ is the only one that currently does not offer
an Java-to-native compilation (Symantec Cafe never successfully built an executable, Metrowerks has
not yet had the chance to try).
<p>J++ promises to be the best in terms of syntax directed editing (although emacs should give it a
run for its money, suitably configured). Symantec Cafe has far and away the longest history behind
it. Metrowerks last release was reviewed badly <I>vis a vis</I> other Windows editors, but the latest
version has not been reviewed.
<p>The debugging environments for the top three IDEs need more serious investigation. Both Symantec
Cafe and Microsoft J++ have had complaints against them (although the 6.0 version of J++ may have
improved somewhat), and Metrowerks is only in its third round of debugging technology under Windows
(although the latest version seems much improved). Some preliminary work with GDB and emacs show
the GNU environment to be a strong contender (if only Cygnus was ready...)

Introduction</H2>
This doc describes at a very high level of detail the purpose and function
of most of the support and facet classes used in containership, composition,
and TOS.

<P>The items covered are:
<UL>
<LI>
Containership facet classes: these implement various relationships between
elements in a containment hierarchy.</LI>

<LI>
Presentation classes: these describe the presented state of an in-world
object in a TOS-checkable way.</LI>

<LI>
Location classes: these describe the in-container location of an object.&nbsp;
(There is much unused stuff in here.)</LI>
</UL>

describes the uses of a lot of these pieces.
<H2>
Requirements</H2>
Since this is explaining three different pieces, I'll lay out the requirements
for each.
<OL>
<LI>
Containership facet classes:&nbsp; These generally need to fulfill one
of four requirements in the containership protocol.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
Queueing messages that need to be held until the current object is no longer
"in transition".&nbsp; (Generally we queue incoming messages.)&nbsp; (QueueingFacet)</LI>

<LI>
Providing a wrapper capability that encapsulates an identifying key.&nbsp;
(IdentiFacet)</LI>

<LI>
Entering a revoked state after which messages can no longer be sent via
that facet.&nbsp; (RevokableFacet)</LI>

<LI>
Routing all messages from one facet to another.&nbsp; (RouterTether)</LI>
</OL>

<LI>
Presentation classes:&nbsp; The presentation state must contain the complete
information (name, scale, appearance file(s), swatched information) needed
to depict an object on-screen.&nbsp; Appearance-based TOS checking is done
based on the state of this object as presented by an unum requesting entry
to a region.</LI>

<LI>
Location classes:&nbsp; These need to describe the complete state of where
an object is in a container, whether that container is a 3D container (like
a region), or a slotted container (like an avatar or a table).&nbsp; They
also started out being a basis for a demented half-baked form of path planning.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
Architecture</H2>

<H3>
Oldocosm Architecture Overview</H3>
Once again, in three parts:
<H4>
Containership facet classes</H4>

<OL>
<LI>
Each interface which is associated with a facet currently defines an explicit
wrapper class for that facet.&nbsp; Up until the invention of deflectors
in old-E, an explicit class per facet was needed.&nbsp; And in fact it
was worse than that:&nbsp; you needed an explicit class for each combination
of {interface &amp; facet properties}.&nbsp; In containership, we had two
interfaces (container-to-containable and containable-to-container) and
about three sets of properties (routing, queueing, identifying), resulting
in six facet classes.</LI>

<LI>
eRevokableFacet is the superclass of revokable facets.</LI>

<LI>
eFacetInterest is an oddball class that allows you to register interest
in a proxy dying via E messages sent into a channel.&nbsp; (The scenario
is, you have a channel that will eventually get forwarded to a proxy, and
you want to know when the proxy it eventually gets forwarded to goes away.&nbsp;
So you forward a by-copy eFacetInterest instance to the channel.&nbsp;
Then you send an E notification message into the channel, and the eFacetInterest
intercepts it and hangs your callback off of its contained proxy.)&nbsp;
This is all way more complexity than should be needed.</LI>

<LI>
ECbsupCRouterTether is an example of a facet that routes messages from
one facet to another.&nbsp; It receives messages sent to a containable's
facet, and relays those messages via a generic routing method to the unum
router of the containable.&nbsp; In other words, it lets messages get relayed
to an unum router from a containership facet.&nbsp; This is so a container
can send unum messages to things it contains.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
Presentation classes</H4>
There is one class, PresentationState, which contains all the relevant
presentation state.&nbsp; It is a historical amalgam of various pieces
of state, and is severely underdocumented.
<BR>The PresentationState currently contains:
<OL>
<LI>
presenterType (prop, compositor prop (i.e. prop-with-children), or avatar)</LI>

<LI>
another presenter flag indicating whether this object should display its
children in a list or not</LI>

<LI>
a vector of the dataholders comprising the base appearance of the object</LI>

<LI>
a hashtable mapping texture-slot names to dataholders (this is the swatching
table)</LI>

<LI>
the object's scale</LI>

<LI>
the object's name</LI>

<LI>
the object's spatial state--i.e. bounding box (not currently used)</LI>

<LI>
a sequence number used in making changes to PresentationState</LI>

<LI>
a string referencing the thumbnail image for this object</LI>

<LI>
a flag indicating whether the object is stationary (not pickupable) --
this should probably not be in PresentationState</LI>

<LI>
something called myStartupDataMaker which I have no idea what it is</LI>

<LI>
the object's initial location -- this arguably should also not be in PresentationState,
but is there currently as a crufty way of initializing the object's location</LI>
</OL>
All TOS checking of appearances is done on the vector of base appearance
dataholders as well as the hashtable of applied texture dataholders.
<BR>The security model <I>should</I> be that the region contains the PresentationStates
which are used to present all objects in the region, so any changes to
those PresentationStates can only happen if the region allows them.&nbsp;
In particular, this means that objects do not get full capabilities to
change the state of the presenters that the region gives them; the region
creates presenters based solely on PresentationState, and if the object
wants to change its presentation, it needs to update its PresentationState
and send it to the region.
<BR>This means that any aspect of presentation that can be subject to region-level
TOS should be in the PresentationState.
<H4>
Location classes</H4>
The current classes have way more state than is actually used.
<BR>The SpatialState object describes an unum's extent in the world.&nbsp;
Its state is:
<OL>
<LI>
The object's radius</LI>

<LI>
The object's origin (a comment says "relevant mainly for floors" but I
can't remember why)</LI>

<LI>
The object's area (as a Polygon2DFloat, which is one of the geometry support
classes)</LI>

<LI>
A flag indicating whether the object is a floor whose area denotes the
floor's outer edges, or an object whose area denotes the object's boundary</LI>
</OL>
The FloorPlane object describes one (of many?!) floor planes in a containing
space.&nbsp; 'Nuff said since we don't have multiple floors and this was
TERRIBLY half-baked.
<BR>The SpaceMap object describes a set of FloorPlanes and connections
between them.&nbsp; See FloorPlane.
<BR>The Location object, on the other hand, is actually used.&nbsp; It
contains the position of an object within its container; this position
may be either a 3D point or a (String-valued) slot name.&nbsp; The Location
also contains the object's orientation within that container.&nbsp; (It
didn't use to, but it was clearly the right thing for this to go here,
since orientation should generally be just as consistent as position.)
<BR>The SurfaceLocation object was intended to help support spaces with
more than one floor; it gave you a way to say which floor a given Location
was located on.&nbsp; Yes, this was and is crufty, and in fact the additional
state of a SurfaceLocation is totally unused right now.
<BR>The SurfacePath object describes a path along a (set of) surface(s).&nbsp;
Also mostly unused now.
<BR>There are also a set of 2D-geometry Java support classes in j_Space.java,
such as Polygon2DFloat, Line2DFloat, PolygonSet2DFloat, etc., which are
one conceivable starting point for better path planning.
<H3>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H3>

<H4>
Containership facets</H4>
The eFacetInterest business is subsumed by some much simpler new-E machinery
(namely the resolution() and whenBroken() calls).
<BR>The class bloat for different types of facets can be almost totally
ameliorated by using El Cheapo deflectors deflecting to generic queueing/revokable/identification
facet tethers.&nbsp; (i.e. you just have a generic El Cheapo object which
routes messages to a generic facet that handles them in a generic way.)&nbsp;
You could even define an identifacet version that prepends a key argument
to all the methods in the interface.
<BR>Many of the router tethers are half-baked and should probably not be
necessary in a rethought overall design.

<P>Actually almost all of these go away in the <A HREF="containment/Containment.html">current
containership proposal</A> since there are no longer direct relationships
between containers and containables as such; there are DObject facets between
presences, but there are not direct facets between the base host presences.&nbsp;
Scott's BasicContainable/BasicContainer DObject facets are more likely
the replacement for most of these.&nbsp; But the above implementation notes
are still germane if we do need "host-to-host" facets.
<H4>
Presentation state</H4>
The PresentationState class is still very much a good idea, but needs some
generification.

<P>I propose that PresentationState become a generic superclass.&nbsp;
ECHabitatPresentationState will be the concrete subclass for EC's variety
of presentation state.&nbsp; This would allow the containership protocol
to be more generic with respect to the EC Habitats application.

<P>The specific fields of ECHabitatPresentationState should be (this is
mostly unchanged from above):
<OL>
<LI>
presenterType (prop, compositor prop (i.e. prop-with-children), or avatar)</LI>

<LI>
another presenter flag indicating whether this object should display its
children in a list or not</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This one may be debatable... this should probably just be rolled into the
presenterType.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
a vector of the dataholders comprising the base appearance of the object</LI>

<LI>
a hashtable mapping texture-slot names to dataholders (this is the swatching
table)</LI>

<LI>
the object's scale</LI>

<LI>
the object's name</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The scale and name are not handled consistently throughout the code at
present.&nbsp; We can fix this by making scale and name both be handled
by the same presentation-state-change TOS path as all other presentation
state.&nbsp; This would both make scale and name be TOS-checkable, and
would eliminate the potential for divergent state handling and its related
bugs.</LI>

<LI>
Note that name should potentially be internationalizable!!!</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
the object's spatial state--i.e. bounding box</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
See below for proposals on changes to the location information.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
a string referencing the thumbnail image for this object</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
If we had a way to dynamically generate thumbnails for an object given
only its base appearance information, this would not be necessary.&nbsp;
However it isn't generally convenient to do so... though we should probably
look into this again.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>
The following items should be extricated from PresentationState altogether,
and moved outside into supporting data structures or protocols.&nbsp; The
object's initial location is especially problematic.
<OL>
<LI>
a sequence number used in making changes to PresentationState</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
It is not clear that this is necessary.&nbsp; In fact this should be external
to the PresentationState itself.&nbsp; The reason for having this at all
is that if a particular change to presentation state is rejected, the code
then needs to roll back to some prior presentation state.&nbsp; However,
if a subsequent change has been requested before the first change was rejected,
then rollback confusion can occur; only the most recent change should be
rolled back.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
a flag indicating whether the object is stationary (not pickupable)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This should likely not be in PresentationState at all.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
something called myStartupDataMaker which I have no idea what it is</LI>

<LI>
the object's initial location</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Again, this has no real place in PresentationState; it is there simply
as a crufty way of putting the object's initial location into some data
structure bound to the object, since location is and will forever be the
peskiest sort of extrinsic context.&nbsp; In some sense the location of
an object in its container is rather like the hints information of a dataholder;
in both cases the location/hints are not properly part of the object but
are information <I>about</I> the object, yet in the code it is frequently
more convenient to couple them.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>

<H5>
PresentationStateDeltas</H5>
There is one additional piece of functionality that the PresentationState
base class should declare and that all subclasses should implement.&nbsp;
The PresentationState, as a single object describing the complete presentation
state, is the right abstraction for presenting a set of objects to a brand
new context; all the information needed is encapsulated in the one object.&nbsp;
However, when requesting <I>changes</I> to a given PresentationState, typically
only a few fields are actually changing.&nbsp; In that case, shipping the
entire PresentationState object around is very wasteful.
<BR>So there needs to be another class, PresentationStateDelta, which completely
encapsulates the difference between one PresentationState object and another.&nbsp;
Given a PresentationState, it should be possible to call pstate.makeDelta(otherpstate)
on it, obtaining a PresentationStateDelta.&nbsp; This can then be applied
to a PresentationState via pstate.applyDelta(pstateDelta) (which should
likely return a new PresentationState rather than side-effecting pstate
itself).
<BR>This would be moderately painful to maintain, but very convenient to
use... subclasses, such as ECHabitatPresentationState, could still expose
their fields as simple methods; and changes to presentation state could
be shipped around far more minimally.&nbsp; Typically the only place PresentationStateDelta
objects would appear in the protocol is in the methods supporting changes
to presentation state.
<H4>
Location state</H4>
The Location and spatial classes need extensive revisiting in light of
what sorts of path-planning and positional security we want in the product.
<BR>At a minimum, the base Location class should be extended with the name
of the "destination object".&nbsp; This would <I>greatly</I> improve the
usability of console mode, if the Location was named in a human-readable
way.&nbsp; Currently it is very easy to know the name of the destination
object at the time that a Location is constructed by that object; but we
simply throw that state away.&nbsp; We shouldn't continue to do so.
<H5>
Path planning plans</H5>
In general, I am going to continue on the assumption that we have no path
planning to speak of... changes in renderer or in customer requirements
would make almost anything we set out to do rapidly obsolete.
<BR>HOWEVER, if I <I>were</I> going to do something, here's what it would
be:
<OL>
<LI>
Use SpatialState to define a 2D bounding polygon for each object.</LI>

<LI>
Define one floor plane for each space.</LI>

<LI>
Use something like the current path-planning code to make avatars walk
around objects.</LI>

<LI>
If an avatar attempts to walk into the middle of an object, let it do so.</LI>

<LI>
Do nothing to prevent avatars walking through each other.</LI>
</OL>
The main reason for the latter two points is that doing otherwise opens
up the possibility of incredibly annoying behavior on the part of other
avatars--they could block your way from getting where you want to go, etc.&nbsp;
Actually it's arguable that this should be dealt with just by leaving,
since we already have other hacks (i.e. creating enormous objects that
block off particular camera views) that have similar irritating effects.&nbsp;
Generally it's probably not worth spending much time on this though, at
least not without particular requirements from a customer with a world
in mind.
<H3>
Off the shelf alternatives</H3>
None to speak of in this particular space.&nbsp; Facets are a problem all
our own; presentation almost certainly likewise (whatever renderer we use
will still take some combo of 3D info and texture info, both of which will
still be certified and recorded in some way); and location is potentially
open for discussion, at the risk of major feature creep.
<H2>
Current implementation</H2>
<I>This section should give details of the major classes and interfaces.</I>
<H4>
Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>

<UL>
<LI>
Containership facet classes: cosm1/objects/ingredients/containership/Containership_facet.plu</LI>

<LI>
Presentation classes: cosm1/objects/ingredients/support/j_Utilities.java</LI>

<LI>
Location classes: cosm1/objects/ingredients/support/{j_Utilities.java,j_Space.java}</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>
No, and likely never will be, as much of it is Pluribus code.
<H4>
Examples</H4>
None... well actually there is, or was, a small test app for some of the
2D polygon stuff.&nbsp; RobJ might be hard pressed to lay hands on it,
though.
<H4>
Testing and Debugging</H4>
<I>(Optional) Lists any tests and debugging utilities which are to be developed
to help test the design (e.g. test classes, trace categories, etc)</I>
<H2>
Design Issues</H2>

<H4>
Resolved Issues</H4>
What does appearance TOS checking mean? -- resolved via the PresentationState-managed-by-region
pattern.
<BR>How do we layer disconnection handling with optimistic channel machinery?
-- resolved by the (too-complex) eFacetInterest pattern.
<H4>
Open Issues</H4>
Not really very many other than those above... mainly around the location
model and the path planning bit.

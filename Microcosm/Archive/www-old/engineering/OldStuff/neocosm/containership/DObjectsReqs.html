<h2>High Level Requirements</h2>

<ol>
<li> Provide generic 'space' for arbitrary distributed objects (una), that
are hosted on all participating machines.  This 'space' can be associated
with a 'region' but it also may represent a 'conference' or some other
non-spatial concept that represents an application-level grouping of una.
Allow meaning of group to be defined by application.

<li> Provide minimal but complete support for strategies to keep distributed
state consistent.  Allow una to determine what strategy they need for
maintaining consistency based upon their own behavioral semantics, and
provide an infrastructure that allows these objects to maintain consistency
as desired (ala Ellen's comments).  Do not force una to pay messaging
penalties for consistency when they do not need it.

<li> Make entire system completely robust in the face of network partition
and/or node failure.

<li> Provide minimal but easily implementable support for secure hierarchical
containment, closed containment, slotted containment, and all other kinds
semantics that are represented as two-way relations between una.  This
means providing support for the messaging between una to reliably set
up/break down such relations, and the appropriate clean up of such
relations in the face of network partition.

<li> Complete support for capabilities security in three areas:  1)
Across-process communication for establishing group membership (TOS); 2)
Unum-Unum communication for within-space between-una interaction; 3) Unum
presence to local runtime.  1 supports TOS restrictions on the formation of
open containment relationships.  2 supports unum-level security.  3
protects each local system from undesired behavior of untrusted Una.  2 and
3 are provided by the MicroVat notion.

<li> Provide something that will add value to existing component architecture
systems...e.g. javabeans...with a minimal amount of programmer effort.
Allow the easy use of components not created at EC to add to the system.

<li> Provide something that can leverage on-going work in multipoint
messaging (i.e. java messaging service, T.120, infobus, iBus, etc., etc.),
but still provide significant added technical value by delivering a secure,
object-based distribution system (not something many others are doing in
the multipoint case).

<li> Provide basic notification structure so that una can reliably detect 1)
their own state changes; 2) other una arrival and departure within the
context defined by the object group.

<li> Provide structure so other pieces can be added (e.g. scripting languages
for defining inter-una interaction) without changing any of the distributed
object infrastructure code to support exstensibility.

<li> Use proven approaches for security mechanisms (e.g. post box protocol).
</ol>

<h2>Infrastructure Requirements</h2>

<ol>
<li> All Java
<li> *Minimal* distributed object infrastructure that performs well

<ul>
<li>Design Goal:  code size < 150K uncompressed for core of system
<li>Focus on 'middle'-layer distributed system only
<li>Do not deal with media rendering, UI, or other I/O at all (leverage
  existing work)
<li>Runtime performance bound only by network latency
</ul>
	
<li> Allow deep extensibility without rearchitecture

  <ul>
  <li>Allow easy use of existing EC code
    <ul>
    <li> Identity mechanisms
    <li> Comm system
    <li> Asynch messaging
    <li> Scripting languages
    <li> UI
    <li> Other I/O
    </ul>
  <li>Allow easy addition/use of other's code (e.g. javabeans)
  <li>Allow runtime download of distributed object code without comprimising
      capabilities security concepts
  </ul>
	
<li> Make structure easy to understand, but general enough to support a large
variety of distributed applications
</ol>

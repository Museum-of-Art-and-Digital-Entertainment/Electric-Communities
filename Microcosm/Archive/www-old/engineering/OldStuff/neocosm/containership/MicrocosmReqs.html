<h2>Introduction</h2>

The requirements below are the requirements for containership within
the Microcosm application. The requirements are intentionally
application specific, though in some cases there are additional notes
about how a requirement could be broadened when we think of a
platform that would support applications other than Microcosm.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Agreed Upon Requirements</h3>

These are requirements that everyone has agreed upon (so far!).

<ul>

<li> A region provides a shared "space" in which all objects recursively
and openly contained by the region are visible to some set of
viewers. Both the objects and the viewers can be distributed across
the network i.e. the authoratitive state of N objects in a region may
be on N different machines.

<li> Any network link or node in the system can fail at any time. When
this happens the system must recover and move toward a new
distributed, consistent state. The system should also clearly
communicate what happened to the users, so the failure makes
sense in their terms and they know what to do next.

<li> A container can be open or closed. The contents of an open, visible
container are visible. The contents of a closed container are not
visible (and, ideally, should not take up resources on the viewers'
machines)
<br>
<em>NOTE:</em> This is an area where more general approach may make
sense. Even in Microcosm users see different types of containership
which may need slightly different handling (e.g. open/close
containment, as in a rock in a box, surface containment as in a lamp
on a table, and covering containment as in clothing on an avatar).
And if we're thinking of a platform, then other applications could
have other requirements (e.g. LambdaMOO has many types of containment).

<li> A viewer should not pay any resources for world objects which are
not visible (except for world objects that are being referenced
for other reasons, e.g. a viewing avatar may own objects, in which
case resources are needed to maintain ownership). Another way to say
this is that the objects representing the viewer to viewee
relationship should get cleaned up as soon as the relationship is
broken. No presence spread!

<li> From the users point of view, an object can only be contained by
one container at a time. Though this cannot be enforced globally
without doing some exclusive rights transfer in a larger context, we
must avoid violating the users expectations that an object can
only be in one place at once.

<li> Any object recursively and openly contained by the region is subject
to the TOS limitations of the region. Currently the only TOS
limitation we have is that the object's art must be certified by an
authority acceptable to the region. (Was it a requirement that
containers in general can apply TOS restrictions to their recursive
openly contained contents?)

<li> A region should be able to kick out a specific avatar and prevent
that avatar from re-entering in future (at the moment this is
implemented via an identity check).

<li> If you are sending word balloons to the region you should know if
the other avatars can "hear" you, or, at least, you should know that
they may be in a state where they can't hear you. For example, when
avatars leave the region you're in, you should know when it is unsure
whether they can still hear you (i.e. they're in transition) and you
should know when it is clear that they can't (i.e. they've gone).

<li> The containership and unum model code should have a simple
programmer API, which provides notifications about status changes.

<li> The containership model must provide multiple coordinate
spaces; at least slots (e.g. hand, head etc.) and 3D positions
(e.g. position in region)

<li> It must be possible to save and restore the locally hosted
part of the containership hierarchy.

</ul>

<h3>Still Under Discussion</h3>

The following may or may not be requirements, they're still under discussion

<ul>

<li> An object should not be contained by some container without consent
from both the object and the container i.e. both container and object
have to agree that the object is in the container; either the
container or the object can veto the relationship.

<li>Should TOS limitations be imposed on entry i.e. do we enforce TOS
by exclusion or by allowing entry but encapsulating or constraining
the non compliant object?

<li>Do we need atomic TOS checking? If a tree of objects is to be
admitted do we atomically decide whether to admit all or none
of them?

<li>Should containers and their containables <em>appear</em> atomically
to the user. e.g. should the user ever be able to see an avatar without
its clothes (or vice versa).

<li>Do we need fully hierarchical TOS? e.g. can a box refuse to contain
an obscene picture? Or does only the region (top level container) refuse
objects on TOS grounds?

<li>Can we constrain types of containership transfer to simplify the
problem? e.g. Maybe you can only transfer container A into container B
when container A is closed. Then you would open A once it was
transferred. This would break down the problem into smaller parts -
single level containership transfer and adding a set of objects to a
context.

<li>Is the container authoratitive over the position of contained
objects? Seems likely given that it defines the frame of reference.

<li>Must an explicit viewer (e.g. avatar) be present in order to view
a region? (Can't stop a viewer propogating their view to someone else
but you can refuse to hand out a view without identifying a
responsible party)

<li>Is it necessary to be able to make synchronous calls between
presences on the same machine (e.g. for menu handling, which is
done synchronously in our current implementation?)

</ul>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

These are things that aren't necessary for the first version of "new
Microcosm". But we should keep them in mind. If we come up with a
solution that makes them easy (or they suggest a direction that would
be easy) then that's a bonus.

<ul>

<li>At the moment we just have TOS for appearance. Do we need TOS for
behavior?

<li>Do we need a link between positions and behaviors? e.g. if an
avatar moves toward a box to pick it up, does it go to a different
position than it would if it were going to kick the box? Implementing
this blurs the boundary between model and presentation.

<li>Do we allow avatars to be contained by anything other than the
region (e.g. avatars in boxes, avatars in pockets?)

<li>How do we do amphitheatres? And what are their TOS properties?

</ul>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

The different views on the region should be as consistent as possible.
Complete distributed consistency at all times is impossible. But if
there are no changes to any of the objects in a region, and no network
failures, then all the views should become consistent, after some
(hopefully short, but network delay dependent) time. (Even if there
are changes and failures the system should always be tending toward
distributed consistency, but if changes and failures happen fast
enough it would be possible to have a system that never reached a
consistent state).

<p>

So given the impossibility of complete distributed consistency, the
real question is: how consistent do we have to be? In our application
we are trying to mimic people in the real world in a shared space, so
people have some strong intuitions about how consistent things should
be.

<p>

For example if someone enters a real world room you expect their
clothes and anything they are carrying to come in with them at exactly
the same time. But that's a pretty strong notion of consistency to
maintain in a distributed system where the avatar body, each item of
clothing and the "in hand" object may all be hosted on different
machines.  Even though we may "tend towards consistency" the process
of getting there may seem very surprising to the user. I suspect this
will get us into the messy areas of timing and probability (e.g. we
need a system which usually appears consistent to the viewer within
1/2 a second).

<p>

There may be some mileage in thinking about local and global
consistency. Viewers can tolerate at least some global inconsistency;
they can't see other views so they probably won't notice temporary
differences between them. But if, for example, an object appears
without its contents, or in two places in the same region, it's going
to shatter the illusion we're trying to present.

<p>

From the platform perspective it makes sense to provide different
levels of consistency. Some applications, and even some parts of
applications, will require less strict or more strict consistency than
Microcosm. Ideally each part of the system should be able to choose a
level of consistency appropriate to its needs.

<h2>Visibility</h2>

I've used "visible" and "visibility" a fair bit e.g. "a region
provides a shared space in which all objects recursively and openly
contained by the region are visible to some set of viewers". Clearly
at the low level the object must have some local representation on the
viewers machine in order to be visible, so we're talking about a
distributed object problem.

<p>

But I prefer to talk in terms of visibility rather than unum presences
or whatever, because ultimately the problem we're trying to solve is
showing the user something. This affects how we solve the problem
because, as discussed in the consistency section above, people have
expectations about how things should look.  Solutions which might be
quite acceptable for some general consistency problem may not work at
all when someone is watching the process of moving toward consistency
(and comparing it to their expectations in the real world).

<p>

Talking about visibility is another example of taking a Microcosm
specific view. When thinking of the platform we should be sure that it
supports the kind of visibility we need in Microcosm. But we should
remember that other applications will have different requirements.

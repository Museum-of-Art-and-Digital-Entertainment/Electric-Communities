<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This document describes some ideas for extending the DataComm system
to operate through various types of firewall. There are four basic levels
of problem:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Where the only problem is setting up the firewall to pass incoming
sockets to the listen address on the local machine and advertising the
ip:port used on the firewall machine.</LI>

<LI>Where incoming sockets can not be accepted.</LI>

<LI>Where the only communications permitted throught the firewall are via
outgoing HTTP.</LI>

<LI>Where the only communications permitted throught the firewall are via
outgoing HTTP, and connections must be made to port 80.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>Related Documents</H4>

<P>See <A HREF="NewECommSystem.html">New E Data Comm System</A> for information
about the E Data Comm System.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="DataComm_startup.html">DataComm Startup Protocol</A> for
information on the start up protocol.</P>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>The basic requirements is that the E Data Comm system be able to operate
through firewalls without special configuration of the firewall. Furthermore
this operation should be possible without the cooperation or permission
of the firewall operator.</P>

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<H3><A NAME="HTTP Tunneling"></A><B>HTTP Tunneling</B></H3>

<UL>
<P>HTTP Tunneling works by sending POST requests to a &quot;HTTP server&quot;
and receiving replies. If the firewall allows us to use HTTP on any port,
then we just need the <A HREF="#DataCommHTTP">DataComm HTTP Server</A>
code. Otherwise, if the machine must also support a real HTTP server, we
will use a CGI to redirect the request to the non-port 80 server. Note
that the Java virtual machine is configured to use a firewall proxy with
the Java system properties: http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort. After this
configuration has been set, the URL will use the firewall proxy to contact
hosts outside the firewall.</P>

<P>If we can use HTTP/1.1 instead of HTTP/1.0, we may be able to take advantage
of the reusable TCP connections which are supported in HTTP/1.1. In 1.1,
everyone along the path, including proxys and firewalls has the option
of tearing down the connection after the first round trip, but even if
it only helps on some cases, it would be worth while.</P>

<P>The POST request can be sent through a URLConnection generated from
a URL which specifies a protocol of &quot;http&quot;, a host-name, port-number,
and a path or cgi reference.</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>conn = url.openConnection(); conn.setDoOutput(true); conn.setUseCaches(false);
conn.setRequestProperty(&quot;Content-type&quot;, &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;);</TT></P>

<P><TT>inNotifier.deactivate(); in = null;</TT></P>

<P><TT>return out = conn.getOutputStream();</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>When the input stream is first read, the buffered output is sent:</P>
</UL>

<PRE><TT>        outNotifier.deactivate();
        out.close();
        out = null;

        // An HTTP error will either show up as an IOException, or it
        // will show up as the error response.  If the content type is
        // not &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;, then we are dealing with an
        // error response.
        try {
            in = conn.getInputStream();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException(&quot;HTTP request failed&quot;);
        }

        String contentType = conn.getContentType();
        if (contentType == null ||
                !conn.getContentType().equals(&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;)) {
            throw new IOException(&quot;HTTP request failed&quot;);
        }

        return in;</TT>
</PRE>

<UL>
<P>The request starts out with a fixed header of POST and must include
<TT>Content-length: </TT>header. To be complient with HTTP (see RFC 2068),
it must also include <TT>Content-type:</TT>.</P>

<UL>
<PRE><TT>POST &lt;URI-requested&gt; HTTP/1.0\r\n
Content-type: application/octet-stream\r\n
&quot;Content-length: &quot; + sizeOfData + &quot;\r\n&quot;</TT></PRE>
</UL>

<P>The reply starts out with a fixed <TT>200 OK</TT> header, and also includes
<TT>Content-length:</TT> and <TT>Content-type:</TT>.</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n<BR>
Content-type: application/octet-stream\r\n<BR>
&quot;Content-length: &quot; + sizeOfData + &quot;\r\n&quot;<BR>
\r\n</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>If there is a client error, the reply is a fixed <TT>400 Bad Request</TT>
header.</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request - &lt;message&gt;\r\n<BR>
\r\n</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Followed by the data as a transparent byte stream. The system allways
sends a least one byte of data (a nul) to support clients that object to
zero bytes of data.</P>

<P>The receiver must discard any extra data which follows the sizeOfData
bytes in the byte stream. The receiver must also skip all the other headers
until it reads the blank line (or line consisting only of line terminators
or whatever).</P>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="DataCommHTTP"></A><B>DataComm HTTP Server</B></H3>

<UL>
<P>The DataComm HTTP server process acts as a remote proxy for the firewalled
vat client. The proxy supports a listen address where the vat can be contacted,
and several TCP links to other vats. The protocol between the client and
the proxy server identifies the TCP&nbsp;link with which a set of data
is associated. Note that since normal vat-to-vat authentication and privacy
measures are used, the client to proxy link does not need either encryption
or authentication. However, some level of authentication would help discourage
denial of service attacks. Since all communication is driven by the client,
the proxy needs to be able to time out the client listen address and the
TCP links. See also <A HREF="#Server Design">Server Design</A>.</P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Note on Timeouts: It is possible that a slow link will
result in it taking longer for the clent to send a HTTP_Session message
than the server timeout. If the server can detect that the client has started
sending a message, it can then use continued progress in receiving the
message as the timeout criterien rather than just receipt of the message.
This kind of timeout is straight forward when the client is connected directly
to the server. I don't know if it is possible when the client messages
are being redirected by a CGI.</FONT></P>
</UL>

<H3><B>Client - Proxy <FONT SIZE=+1>Message Formats</FONT></B></H3>

<UL>
<P>This protocol uses messages formatted with java.io.DataOutputStream.
The protocol uses writeUTF(), writeByte(), writeShort()&nbsp;(read with
readUnsignedShort()), and write(byte[]) in sending the data. In the descriptions
below, the first three are refered to as UTF, byte, and short. The notation
&quot;byte[]&quot; is also used. All byte[] parameters are assumed to be
proceeded by a short giving the length of the byte array.</P>

<P>The <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Logon">HTTP_Logon</A></TT> message includes a
list of acceptable protocol version numbers. The versionID described in
this document is &quot;T1&quot;. </P>

<P>All messages between the client and the proxy are carried in HTTP envelopes
as described under <A HREF="#HTTP Tunneling">HTTP Tunneling</A>. Each of
the major messages types (<TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Logon">HTTP_Logon</A></TT>,
<TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Session">HTTP_Session</A></TT>, <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Shutdown">HTTP_Shutdown</A></TT>,
and <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Error">HTTP_Error</A></TT>) are carried in a separate
HTTP interchange.</P>

<H4>Message Type codes</H4>

<P>All message and response types are single bytes. The assigned values
are:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Logon">HTTP_Logon</A></TT> = 0x01;</P>

</UL>

<H4>Client Authentication</H4>

<P>There is a trade off between server performance and the ability of a
hostile user to cause denial of service attacks on the server and it's
clients. Most of these attacks can be eliminated by authenticating the
logon message and using the VatID to control access to the server (for
billing or to eliminate bad actors).</P>

<P>The server can check three levels of authentication. If the server never
checks signatures, anyone who knows the vatID and the server URL can deny
service to that vatID by sending a <TT>HTTP_Logon</TT> with that vatID.
If the server checks the <TT>clientNonce</TT>, it protects against this
attack by requiring an attacker to have a signed <TT>HTTP_Logon</TT> message.
However, the message could come from having snooped the vat's communications.
If the server checks require that the vat sign a random number provided
by the server, and the server saves the last number it issued the client
and makes sure the client is returning that number, then the server knows
it is communicating with the client. The server should also ensure that
the vatID is the hash of the public key.</P>

<P>The server can dynamically decide how much authentication to require.
A policy of only checking authentication if the vatID is already logged
on seems reasonable.</P>

<H4>Message Descriptions</H4>

<P><A NAME="HTTP_Logon"></A>HTTP_Logon Message </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;byte HTTP_Logon&gt; &lt;UTF VatID&gt; &lt;byte[]serverNonce&gt;
&lt;byte[]clientNonce&gt; &lt;byte[]publicKey&gt; &lt;byte[]signature&gt;</TT>
- Indicates that &lt;VatID&gt; wants to use the server as a proxy. The
<TT>serverNonce</TT> is a random number generated by the server, the clientNonce
is a random number generated by the client, the public key is the client's
public key, and the signature is the DSA signature over the sequence (as
transmitted) <TT>&lt;HTTP_Logon&gt; &lt;VatID&gt; &lt;serverNonce&gt; &lt;clientNonce&gt;</TT>.
The first time the client sends this message, it specifies a zero length
<TT>serverNonce</TT>. The responses are: </P>

<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_Logged_On"></A>HTTP_LoggedOn&gt; &lt;byte[]sessionID&gt;
&lt;UTF listenAddress&gt;</TT> - Indicates that the logon is successful
and provides a sessionID for the session. The <TT>sessionID</TT> is sufficently
large (64 bits?) that a hacker who is not tapping the communications between
the client and the server can not easily guess it and interfere with the
service. The <TT>listenAddress</TT> is the host:port the server is using
to listen for connections to this vat.</P>

<P>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_Set_Server_Nonce"></A><TT>HTTP_SetServerNonce&gt;
&lt;byte[]serverNonce&gt;</TT> - Indicates that the <TT>serverNonce</TT>
in the logon message was missing or invalid. The client should resend the
<TT>HTTP_Logon</TT> message using the <TT>serverNonce</TT> in this message.</P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="HTTP_Session"></A>HTTP_Session Message</P>

<UL>
<P>The <TT>HTTP_Session</TT> message is used in both directions to pass
data to the proxyed TCP connections, open new TCP connections, respond
to new TCP connections and close TCP connections. The <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Session">HTTP_Session</A>
</TT>message consists of a header and zero or more data segments. (A <TT>HTTP_Session
</TT>message with zero data segments act as Ping/Pong message.) The client
must send an <TT>HTTP_Session </TT>message every n (60?) seconds or the
server will shutdown the session. </P>

<P><A NAME="ConnectionID"></A>Messages which describe a specific TCP connection
use a <TT>&lt;connectionID&gt;</TT> parameter. This parameter is an byte,
limiting the maximum of proxied TCP sessions active to 255. Positive values
are assigned by the client for outgoing connections. Negative values are
assigned by the server for incoming connections. The value zero is not
legal.</P>

<P>Each TCP connection has its own flow control. Both the client and server
should limit the amount of data they send to a connection to the value
in the last <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_OK_To_Send">HTTP_OKToSend</A></TT> message
for that connection.</P>

<P>The header is:</P>

<P><TT>&lt;HTTP_Session&gt; &lt;byte[]sessionID&gt;</TT> </P>

<P>Any number of data segments may be included in the message. The legal
data segments are:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_NewConnection"></A>HTTP_NewConnection&gt; &lt;byte
connectionID&gt; &lt;UTF HostID:port&gt;</TT> - Client to host only. Build
a TCP connection to the specified host and port, and use <A HREF="#ConnectionID">connectionID</A>
to refer to it in subsquent messages. Responses are not necessarily returned
in the same exchanges. They are:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_InvalidID"></A>HTTP_InvalidID&gt; &lt;byte connectionID&gt;</TT>
- The <TT>connectionID</TT> passed is invalid because either there is already
a connection using that ID, or because the ID has the wrong sign. All connections
with that ID are closed. This response is also used for <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Data">HTTP_Data</A></TT>,
<TT><A HREF="#HTTP_OK_To_Send">HTTP_OKToSend</A></TT>, and <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Close">HTTP_Close</A></TT>
to indicate there is no connection established for that ID.</P>

<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_ConnectionFailed"></A>HTTP_ConnectionFailed&gt;
&lt;byte connectionID&gt; &lt;UTF reason&gt;</TT> - The connection could
not be make. <TT>&lt;reason&gt;</TT> is a textual message describing the
reason for the failure.</P>

<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_ConnectionComplete"></A>HTTP_ConnectionComplete&gt;
&lt;byte connectionID&gt;</TT> - The connection is ready to accept data.</P>
</UL>

<P><TT>&lt;HTTP_NewConnection&gt; &lt;byte connectionID&gt; &lt;UTF host:port&gt;</TT>
- Server to client only. A new TCP connection has been established to the
server's listen port for this VatID. The host and port are those of the
remote end of the TCP connection. </P>

<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_Data"></A>HTTP_Data&gt; &lt;byte connectionID&gt;
&lt;byte[]data&gt;</TT> - Indicates data to be passed to/received from
the TCP connection. This data segment may return <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_InvalidID">HTTP_InvalidID</A></TT>
if there is no connection associated with the <TT><A HREF="#ConnectionID">connectionID</A></TT>
passed. If data is longer than the limit in the last <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_OK_To_Send">HTTP_OKToSend</A></TT>,
then the return will be <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_ConnectionFailed">HTTP_ConnectionFailed</A></TT>.</P>

<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_OK_To_Send"></A>HTTP_OKToSend&gt; &lt;byte connectionID&gt;
&lt;short bytesOfData&gt;</TT> - Indicates that the other end may send
up to <TT>bytesOfData</TT> to the connection <TT><A HREF="#ConnectionID">connectionID</A></TT>.
This data segment may return <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_InvalidID">HTTP_InvalidID</A></TT>
if there is no connection associated with the connectionID passed.</P>

<P><TT>&lt;<A NAME="HTTP_Close"></A>HTTP_Close&gt; &lt;byte connectionID&gt;
&lt;UTF reason&gt;</TT> - Closes/indicates the connection has been closed.
<TT>&lt;reason&gt;</TT> is a textual message describing the reason for
the close. This data segment may return <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_InvalidID">HTTP_InvalidID</A></TT>
if there is no connection associated with the <TT><A HREF="#ConnectionID">connectionID</A></TT>
passed.</P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="HTTP_Shutdown"></A>HTTP_Shutdown Message</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;HTTP_Shutdown&gt; &lt;byte[]sessionID&gt;</TT> - Ends the session
between the client and the server. The server closes all the TCP connections
it has open on behalf of the client and stops listening for new connections
to the client. If the shutdown was initiated by the client, the response
(server to client) is:</P>

<P><TT>&lt;HTTP_Shutdown&gt; &lt;byte[]sessionID&gt;</TT> - Shutdown complete</P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="HTTP_Error"></A>HTTP_Error</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>&lt;HTTP_Error&gt; &lt;byte[]sessionID&gt; &lt;UTF reason&gt;</TT>
- An error occured on the session and it must be shut down. <TT>reason</TT>
is a textual message describing the error. Possible errors are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;Session not active&quot; - Perhaps because it has been timed
out</LI>

<LI>&quot;Protocol error xxx&quot; - An invalid message was received. xxx
may provide more detail.</LI>

<P>If an HTTP_Error message is received by the server, the response will
be an HTTP_Shutdown message.</P>

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>

<P>The transport layer of RMI uses similar techniques, but it is not an
exposed interface.</P>

<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>

<H2>Current implementation</H2>

<H3>Server</H3>

<P>This server design is a reference implementation. It is designed for
clarity, not efficency. Being written in Java, it uses threads out the
yingyang.</P>

<P>HTTPServeMain is the class which contains the main routine. It also
listens to the HTTP port.</P>

<P>HTTPServeClientPeer is the class which handles HTTP input and output
for a particular client.</P>

<P>HTTPServeClientState is the class which holds the client state between
HTTP messages.</P>

<P>None. </P>

<H2>Design Proposal</H2>

<H3><A NAME="Server Design"></A>Server</H3>

<P>The server waits for E connections on one port and HTTP requests on
another. When the server gets an <TT>HTTP_Logon</TT> message, it builds
the necessary data structures to service that vatID, generates a sessionID,
and sends the sessionID in the HTTP response. The data structures include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A way to queue received TCP messages to be sent to the client via HTTP.</LI>

<LI>A way to associate the connectionIDs with the associated TCP connection.</LI>

<LI>A way to queue messages received via HTTP on the appropriate TCP connection</LI>

<LI>A way to map from VatID to the HTTP connection for new incoming E connections.</LI>

<LI>The maximum amount of data the server can send the client for each
connection.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The basic dataflow logic for various messages is:</P>

<UL>
<P>New incoming TCP E connection</P>

<UL>
<P>The server reads the new socket and saves the <TT>PROTOCOL_VERSION</TT>
message (see <A HREF="DataComm_startup.html">Comm Connection Startup Protocol</A>).
It saves and reads the <TT>IWANT</TT> message and checks if it is proxying
for the requested VatID. If the VatID is not known, it generates a <TT>NOTME
</TT>response and closes the socket. Otherwise it associates the socket
with the appropriate HTTP connection and generates three <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Session">HTTP_Session</A></TT>
submessages for the <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_NewConnection">HTTP_NewConnection</A></TT>,
the <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_OK_To_Send">HTTP_OKToSend</A></TT>, and the <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Data">HTTP_Data</A></TT>
which are queued for the HTTP connection.</P>
</UL>

<P>Incoming data on the TCP&nbsp;E&nbsp;connection</P>

<UL>
<P>The server reads the data and queues it on the appropriate HTTP connection
as a <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Data">HTTP_Data</A></TT> message.</P>
</UL>

<P>Incoming close on the TCP E connection</P>

<UL>
<P>The server queues a <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Close">HTTP_Close</A></TT> message
on the appropriate HTTP connection.</P>
</UL>

<P>Incoming HTTP message from the client</P>

<UL>
<P>The data portion of the HTTP&nbsp;POST operation is read and the embeded
messages are processed. When they have been processed, the output queue
for the HTTP&nbsp;connection is encoded and sent back in the response.
Note that the output queue is a FIFO queue to preserve the ordering of
events. The specific POST messages are handled as follows:</P>

<P><TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Logon">HTTP_Logon</A></TT> from the HTTP client</P>

<UL>
<P>If there is already a session in progress for this VatID, the server
performs the following checks:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Check that the client is using the strong authentication form of logon,
that the server has sent a nonce to this vatID within the timeout interval,
and that the serverNonce from the client matches the last one the server
sent to the client. If not send a <TT>HTTP_Set_Server_Nonce</TT> message
requesting a new logon and record the random number send associated with
the vatID.</LI>

<LI>Check that the vatID is the hash of the public key. If not, sent <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Error">HTTP_Error</A></TT>.</LI>

<LI>Check the signature. If it doesn't check, send <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Error">HTTP_Error</A></TT>.</LI>

<LI>Shutdown the old session.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Generate a new sessionID, build the necessary data structures, and queue
a <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Logged_On">HTTP_LoggedOn</A></TT> message as the response.</P>
</UL>

<P><TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Session">HTTP_Session</A></TT></P>

<UL>
<P>Each subtype is processed as follows:</P>

<P><TT><A HREF="#HTTP_NewConnection">HTTP_NewConnection</A></TT> from the
HTTP client</P>

<UL>
<P>The server checks the parameters to ensure they are valid. If they are
not valid, an error response is queued for the HTTP connection. Otherwise
an asynchronous operation is started to build the TCP connection. It will

</UL>

<P><TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Data">HTTP_Data</A></TT> from the HTTP client</P>

<H3>Client </H3>

<P>The client code involves changes to the current DataComm software. There
are two obvious versions of the client that can be imagined:</P>

<OL>
<LI>A client that performs all its communication through HTTP Tunnelling</LI>

<LI>A client that is able to build &quot;classic&quot; direct TCP connections
to some vats and uses HTTP Tunnelling for others.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The client that supports both direct and tunnelled connections has a
number of problems to solve:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Which path should it try to connect to a particular vat?</LI>

<LI>What address should it list with the PLS?</LI>

<LI>How can it assure that it only has one connection to a particular vat
(to preserve the E message ordering rules).</LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="Tunnel Only"></A><B>Tunnel Only</B></P>

<P>Extend the VatIdentity class to have a getConnectionsManager(URL url)
method. The url specifies the HTTP Tunnel server.</P>

<P>Change DataComm to use a SocketFactory to get its Sockets. For direct
connections, this factory returns standard system Sockets. For Tunnel connections,
a different factory returns Sockets which use the HTTP Tunnel classes for
communication. For incoming connections, the HTTP Tunnel classes can call
ConnectionsManager.newInboundSocket directly or through a Thunk. The Tunnel
classes can directly return the address the server is listening at to the
ConnectionsManager using the listeningAt(String) method.</P>

<P>The TunnelSocket will respond to as follows to the standard Socket methods:</P>

<UL>
<LI>close() Closes this socket. Sends a <TT><A HREF="#HTTP_Close">HTTP_Close</A></TT>
message and performs cleanup of the local resources.</LI>

<LI>getInetAddress() Returns the address to which the socket is connected.
This address will either be simulated as best we can or DataComm will be

<P><B>Tunnel and Direct</B></P>

<P>With the above <A HREF="#Tunnel Only">Tunnel Only</A> architecture and
some additional changes, there are simple answers to the Tunnel and Direct
questions. The changes are to allow more than one socketFactory to be active
in the objects under a particular ConnectionsManager. The use of multiple
factories also allows the vat to listen on more than one interface:port.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Which path should it try to connect to a particular vat?</LI>

<P>Try them all. First try all the search addresses through each direct
connection interface. Then try all the URLs registered for Tunnel connections.</P>

<LI>What address should it list with the PLS?</LI>

<P>All the addresses it is listening at. Even if they are not relevant
to a particular network, trying to connect to them will fail unless there
is a vat with the desired private key listening there.</P>

<LI>How can it assure that it only has one connection to a particular vat
(to preserve the E message ordering rules).</LI>

<P>By running under one ConnectionsManager, duplicate DataConnections will
be prevented.</P>

<H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>

<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>

<P><I>In many cases, this section can link to JavaDoc output from actual
Java classes and interfaces. This saves writing documentation twice (the
designers will have to JavaDoc their interfaces anyway). The JavaDoc should
be linked into the design document. <A HREF="../../../tools/javadoc.html">Chip's
JavaDoc style guidelines</A> explain how to use JavaDoc effectively.</I>

<H2>Design Issues</H2>

<UL>
<LI>This server design will not accept incoming TCP connections to VatID
== &quot;0&quot;, the connectToVatAt protocol because it supports more
than one vat.</LI>

<LI>The unauthenticated logon allows anyone who knows the VatID and the
HTTP server that vat is using to disconnect all that vat's connections.</LI>

<LI>How does the firewall HTTP proxy address get set up?</LI>

<P>The user uses the Java system properties: http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort
to set the host and port of the firewall proxy.</P>

<LI>A vat which receives a connection where the originator goes through
an HTTP Tunnel may be able to make a direct connection back. This will
occur if the vat can not receive direct connections, but can make them.
The architecture has no way to try for this direct connection.</LI>

<P>The Connection Startup Protocol uses messages formatted with java.io.DataOutputStream.
The first byte of the message is one of the types defined in ec.elib.net.data.Msg.
PROTOCOL_VERSION, PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED, and STARTUP are used in the startup
protocol. The startup protocol uses writeUTF(), writeShort()&nbsp;(read
with readUnsignedShort()), and write(byte[]) in sending the pieces of the
protocol. These are refered to as UTF, short, and byte[] in the descriptions
below.</P>

<P>The PROTOCOL_VERSION message: (byte type=PROTOCOL_VERSION=1, UTF 1stProtocolID,
UTF 2ndProtocolID, ...). The only protocol version currently supported
is &quot;E1&quot;.</P>

<P>The PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED message: (byte type=PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED=3, UTF protocolID).</P>

<P>The STARTUP message is used for all the rest of the messages: (byte
type=STARTUP=2, byte token, arguments). Where arguments and their format
are defined in the protocol description below, and token is defined in
ec.elib.net.data.StartUpProtocol and is one of:</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Connection Establishment</FONT></B></P>

<P>There are three layers of code responsible for connections in the data
comm system. The top level is ConnectionsManager. It is responsible for
all the connections between a E vat and other vats. It includes methods
such as &quot;DataConnection getConnection(remoteVatID , searchPath)&quot;
and &quot;connectToVatAt(IP:port)&quot; which either create a connection
and returns it, or return an existing connection.</P>

<P>The connection to a specific other vat is handled by the DataConnection
object. It is responsible for building new connections and resuming suspended
connections.</P>

<P>The connection to a specific machine is handled by the DataPath object.
It, along with its SendThread and RecvThread, handles one TCP connection.</P>

<P>The normal connection build process starts with the connection call
to the ConnectionsManager described above. The remoteVatID parameter specifies
which specific vat is wanted, and the searchPath parameter specifies places
to look for it. The search path is normally a set of Process Location Servers
to query. There is a specific VatID (&quot;0&quot;) which is recognized
as &quot;any vat listening at the IP:port passed in the connectToVatAt()
call on the ConnectionsManager.</P>

<P>The search for a vat starts by building a DataPath to the first address
on the search path, normally a PLS. If that PLS knows where the vat is,
it returns the IP address and port number which is inserted into the search
path. The currently active instance of DataPath has then completed it's
job, so it closes the TCP connection, and notifies the DataConnection that
it has shutdown. The DataConnection then builds a new DataPath to try the
next address in the search path.</P>

<P>The connection startup protocol (Alice is connecting to Bob) used by
the DataPath is as follows. Note that there are two interleaved protocol
negotiations involved. The version of the E protocol to use, and the low
level encryption/compression protocol. The E protocol negotiation is over
quickly, while the encryption protocol negotiation involves the exchange
of keys and the verification of identities.</P>

<P>In the description below, &lt;PROBLEM&gt; is one of ERR_PROTOCOL, if
a wrong protocol message type was received or the remote end is using an
unsupported version of the protocol, or ERR_WRONG_ID if the far end responds
IAM for the wrong vatID or the remote public key does not hash to the vatID.
TOK_ERR_INTERNAL is used to notify the other end that an internal error
has caused the connection attempt to fail.</P>

<P>The protocol is described using the notation, &quot;Sender: message
paremeters (comments)&quot;</P>

<PRE>-------------------Outgoing Startup State------------------------

    or  &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)
</PRE>

<PRE>-------------------Outgoing Expect IAM State---------------------</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives TRY, as she would from the PLS, she adds the &lt;possibleAlternatePath&gt;
to her search path and shuts down the DataPath. If she receives NOTME (NotMe)
she just shuts down the DataPath without adding to the path. The DataConnection
will build a new DataPath to try the next entry in the path (if any).</P>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's IAM:</P>

<PRE> Alice: GIVEINFO &lt;UTF aliceVatID&gt; &lt;UTF alicesPathToAlice&gt;
                 &lt;short keyLen&gt; &lt;byte[]alicePublicKey&gt;</PRE>

<PRE>    or  NOTME                                (Bob's VatID is the same as Alice's)
    or  DUP                                  (duplicated connection, quietly stop)
    or  &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)
</PRE>

<PRE>-----------------Incoming Expect GIVEINFO State------------------</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives Alice's NOTME, he recognizes that Alice tried to connect
to herself and stops.</P>

<P>If Bob receives Alice's GIVEINFO and Bob only knows of one connection:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: REPLYINFO &lt;UTF cryptoProtocols&gt;           (continue)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives Alice's GIVEINFO and Bob knows of crossed connections
and Bob is the catbird:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: REPLYINFO &lt;UTF&nbsp;cryptoProtocols&gt;              (continue)
    or  DUP                                          (stop, crossed connections)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives Alice's GIVEINFO and Bob knows of crossed connections
and Alice is the catbird:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: YOUCHOSE &lt;UTF cryptoProtocols&gt;              (continue)</PRE>

<P>Where &lt;cryptoProtocols&gt; is a comma separated list of crypto protocol
versions that Bob knows (see &lt;version&gt; below), in order from most
favored to least favored.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Crossed connection notes<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>A crossed connection exists when Alice tries to build a connection
to Bob at the same time Bob is trying to build a connection to Alice. If
Bob's vatID is greater than Alice's, then Bob is the &quot;catbird&quot;
and must decide which of the two connections to use. Otherwise Alice is
the catbird and she must be notified that she is to decide.</P>

<P>Since the GIVEINFO state is on an incoming connection, Bob is in a position
to notice that he is also in the process of building a connection to Alice,
and the potential for crossed connections exists. If he is not the catbird
he notifies Alice that she must decide by sending the YOUCHOSE message.<BR>
<BR>
If he is the catbird, he looks at the state of the outgoing connection.
He decides to keep the incoming or the outgoing connection based on that
state:</P>

<PRE>    ST_UNSTARTED                      Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_IAM            Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_REPLYINFO      Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_GOTOO          Keep outgoing
    ST_EXPECT_MESSAGE                 Keep outgoing</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives the YOUCHOSE message on her outgoing connection attempt,
she looks at the state of any incoming connection for Bob's vatID she may
know about. She decides to keep the incoming or the outgoing connection
based on that state:</P>

<PRE>    No connection known               Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_IWANT          Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_GIVEINFO       Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_GO             Keep incoming
    ST_EXPECT_MESSAGE                 Keep incoming</PRE>

<P>When Bob eliminates the outgoing connection or Alice eliminates the
incoming connection, they shutdown the path they are terminating. This
action causes the TCP connection to be closed and the DataPath to be shutdown.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<PRE>----------------Outgoing Expect REPLYINFO State------------------
</PRE>

<P>If Alice received an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE> Alice: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives a DUP she stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.
If she receives one of the &lt;PROBLEM&gt; responses, she generates an
error log and stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.</P>

<P>If Alice receives a YOUCHOSE, she choses which connection to eliminate.</P>

<PRE> Alice: DUP                           (If she keeps the incoming)</PRE>

<P>Otherwise she processes the YOUCHOSE the same as a REPLYINFO.</P>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's REPLYINFO and there is an outgoing suspendID:</P>

<PRE> Alice: RESUME &lt;short len&gt; &lt;byte[] suspendID&gt;
                                      (resume suspended connection)</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's REPLYINFO and it includes a crypto protocol
Alice supports:</P>

<PRE> Alice: GO &lt;crypto parameters&gt;        (continue)</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's REPLYINFO and CRYPTO_NONE was the selected protocol:</P>

<PRE><TT> Alice: GO (continue, no crypto)

</TT>Otherwise when Alice receives Bob's REPLYINFO:</PRE>

<PRE> Alice: ERR_PROTOCOL                  (can't agree on crypto)


--------------------Incoming Expect GO State---------------------
</PRE>

<P>If Bob received an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                     (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a RESUME from Alice and the suspendID matches his suspendID:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: GOTOO                         (resume connection)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a RESUME and the suspendIDs do not match:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: BYE                           (Wrong suspendID)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a GO and expects a RESUME:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: BYE                           (discarded resumable connection)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a GO and it includes a supported crypto &lt;version&gt;:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: GOTOO &lt;crypto parameters&gt;     (Bob starts encrypted session)</PRE>

<P>Otherwise if the GO does not include a supported crypto &lt;version&gt;:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: GOTOO &lt;CRYPTO_NONE&gt;           (Bob starts unencrypted session)


-------------------Outgoing Expect GOTOO State-------------------</PRE>

<P>If Alice received an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE> Alice: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives a BYE, she stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection
and signals that it has died.</P>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's GOTOO, she starts an encrypted session or unencrypted
session depending on what Bob has sent for &lt;crypto parameters&gt;. Thence
both can send each other E messages according to the message protocol.<BR>

 The value of &lt;version&gt; is selected from the currently supported list:

<P>This section deals with two granualities of message. There are the E
messages, which are a direct result of E.send and E.sendOnly operations.
Several of these messages may be combined into a single TCP level message
for transmission over the TCP connection. This second kind of message will
be called a TCP message.</P>

<P>These TCP&nbsp;messages are described using a notation which gives the
length of each element and it's value. For example, a 4 byte integer length
is described as <TT>(4,length)</TT>. The fields are written one after another
to indicate concatination. For example: <TT>(4,length) (length,data)</TT>.</P>

<P><B>Key generation</B></P>

<P>This encryption version calculated 4 separate &quot;keys&quot;. They
are: a 24 byte 3DES key, a 64 byte MAC key, an 8 byte initial sendIV, and
an 8 byte initial receiveIV. First a Diffie-Hellman secret (<TT>dhSecret</TT>)
is calculated by taking the <TT>g<SUP>x</SUP> mod m</TT> value received
from the other side and calculating <TT>BigInteger secret = (g<SUP>x</SUP>
mod m)<SUP>y</SUP> mod m </TT>using the standard Java BigInteger class.
Then <TT>byte[] dhSecret = secret.toByteArray();</TT> </P>

<P>The individual keys are calculated from <TT>dhSecret </TT>using MD5
and a 16 byte pad consisting of a single byte repeated 16 times as follows:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>3DESKey1</TT> is the first 8 bytes of <TT>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</TT>
with <TT>0x55</TT> for the pad.<BR>

with <TT>0x55</TT> for the pad.<BR>
<TT>3DESKey3</TT> is the first 8 bytes of <TT>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</TT>
with <TT>0xaa</TT> for the pad.</P>

<P><TT>MACKey</TT> is <TT>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</TT> with <TT>0x11</TT>
for the pad followed by <TT>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</TT> with <TT>0x22</TT>

for the pad.</P>

<P>The <TT>sendIV </TT>and <TT>receiveIV </TT>are calculated by <TT>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</TT>
with <TT>0x99</TT> for the pad. If the connection is an outgoing connection,
the <TT>sendIV </TT>is the first 8 bytes and the <TT>receiveIV </TT>is
the second 8 bytes. If the connection is an incoming connection, the <TT>sendIV
</TT>is the second 8 bytes and the <TT>receiveIV </TT>is the first 8 bytes.</P>

<P><B>TCP&nbsp;Message format</B></P>

<P><TT>(n,totalLength) (20,SHA1_MAC) (n,msgLength1) (msgLength1,message)
... (n,pad)</TT></P>

<P>The totalLength and msgLength fields are sent in compressed format.
For values between 0 and 127 (<TT>2<SUP>7</SUP>-1</TT>), the value is sent
as one byte (with one high zero bit). For values between 128 and 16,383
(<TT>2<SUP>14</SUP>-1</TT>), the value is sent as 2 bytes (with two high
zero bits). For values between 16,384 and 2,097,151 (<TT>2<SUP>21</SUP>-1</TT>),
the value is sent as 3 bytes (with three high zero bits). Since the maximum
size message is 1,048,576 (<TT>2<SUP>20</SUP></TT>), this encoding covers
all the legal messages.</P>

<P>The totalLength field is the length in bytes of the all the messages
including their compressed length field. It does not include the 20 byte
Message Authentication Code (MAC), the pad, or the length of the totalLength
field.</P>

<P>The MAC is calculated using SHA1 and the authentication key generated
as part of key generation. The MAC is the result of: <TT>SHA1( (64,MACKey</TT>
<TT>) (n,msgLength1) (msgLength1,message) ... (64,MACKey</TT> <TT>) )</TT>.</P>

<P>After the TCP message is generated as above, it is encrypted using Triple
DES EDE in Cypher Block Chaining mode. (See <I>Applied Cryptography </I>by
Bruce Schneier for details.) The first Initialization Vector (IV) is calculated
as part of key generation. The next TCP message uses an IV which is one
higher than the previous one. The IV is considered to be an 8 byte unsigned
integer in big endian format for this addition.</P>

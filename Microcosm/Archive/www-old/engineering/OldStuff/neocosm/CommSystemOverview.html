<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This description matches the version of the comm system included in
R167. </P>

<P>The comm system includes the following features: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Encrypted links.</LI>

<LI>Unforgeable network object references with handoff logic.</LI>

<LI>SturdyRefs and the Registrar.</LI>

<LI>Message encode/decode.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Related Documents</H4>

<P>See <A HREF="../design_notes/comm_startup.html">Comm system connections
startup protocol</A>. </P>

<P>For the design for the Neocosm data comm layer see: <A HREF="NewECommSystem.html">NewECommSystem</A>.
</P>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>Requirements curently implemented: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Authenticated, confidential links between E &quot;vats&quot; running
on the same or different machines.</LI>

<LI>Robust identities that persist over restarts of the application.</LI>

<LI>Network location independence. An identity can move from one network
address to another.</LI>

<LI>E messages can be passed between vats.</LI>

<LI>Three party handoff: If vat A sends vat B a reference to an object
in vat C, B will get a direct link to C for messages to that object.</LI>

<LI>SturdyRefs: There is a type of inter-vat object reference which persists
over restart of the referer, referee, or both.</LI>

<LI>Allow a vat to build outbound connections and receive inbound connections.
A vat can act as both a client and a server.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Requirements at best partially implemented: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Firewall support: At best, a vat behind a firewall can only build outbound
connections. It can not receive inbound connections.</LI>

<LI>Connections are not torn down when they are no longer being used.</LI>

<LI>The event logging and analysis policies log too many errors.</LI>

<LI>Connections need to be periodically checked to ensure they are still
working. (This is not being done in R167.)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Pure dumb things that need to be fixed: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The byte and network layers need to be removed. They are left over
from vat tethers.</LI>

<LI>The number of threads per connection needs to be reduced to two.</LI>

<LI>The Comm system needs to implement a &quot;keep alive&quot; function
to ensure the other end is still alive.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<P>The Comm system can be considered to consist of four components: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The Registrar which establishes the identity of the vat.</LI>

<LI>The Connections Manager which manages the connections.</LI>

<LI>The (multiple) connections to other vats.</LI>

<LI>The listen stack which listens for new incoming connections.</LI>
</UL>

<H4><FONT SIZE=+2>Current Architecture Overview</FONT></H4>

<P><B>Registrar</B> </P>

<P>Each vat has one instance of the Registrar (ec/e/net/Registrar.java)
which performs the following functions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>It holds the public/private key pair which define the identity of the
vat. (When the vat is initialized, it generates the key pair.)</LI>

<LI>It holds the list of Process Location Servers (PLSs) the vat will register
with when it goes &quot;onTheAir&quot;.</LI>

<LI>It implements the &quot;onTheAir&quot; method which permits the vat
to engage in inter-vat communications, and the &quot;offTheAir&quot; method
which shuts down existing connections and terminates listening..</LI>

<LI>It implements methods for the generation of SturdyRefs to local objects,
following SturdyRefs to remote objects, and exporting transitory references
to local objects.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>ConnectionsManager</B> </P>

<P>Each vat has one instance of the ConnectionsManager (ec/e/net/ConnectionsManager.java)
which performs the following functions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Maintains lists of active and suspended/suspending connections.</LI>

<LI>Accepts new connections from remote vats.</LI>

<LI>Builds new connections to remote vats.</LI>

<LI>Maintains usage information about connections so unused ones will be
the first to be suspended.</LI>

<LI>Handles and logs errors that occur while building connections, or while
they are active.</LI>

<LI>Provides connections statistics in string form for display in a UI.</LI>

<LI>Holds a collection of string values that will be compactly encoded
on the wire.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>The Connections</B> </P>

<P>Each active connection is broken into three layers: </P>

<OL>
<LI>The E layer (ec/e/net/EConnection.java, ec/e/net/ESender.java, and
ec/e/net/EReceiver.java) which:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Maintains the import/export tables for the connection.</LI>

<LI>Places incoming E messages &lt;destObject, envelope&gt; on the E Run
Queue.</LI>

<LI>Sends E messages &lt;destObject, envelope&gt; to the remote vat.</LI>

<LI>Queue messages for connections which are not active.</LI>

<LI>Handle the three party handoff.</LI>

<LI>Process the distributed garbage collection messages.</LI>

<LI>Builds the necessary Msg layer for each location in the search path
during vat location resolution. (PLS lookup)</LI>
</UL>

<LI>The Msg layer (ec/e/net/MsgConnection.java, ec/e/net/MsgSender.java,
and ec/e/net/MsgReceiver.java) which:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Represents one TCP connection.</LI>

<LI>Handles the <A HREF="../design_notes/comm_startup.html">Connection
startup protocol</A> including E msg protocol version negoitation and crypto
suite negoitation.</LI>

<LI>Generates cryptographic keys for message privacy and authentication.</LI>

<LI>Authenticates the remote end of the connection.</LI>

<LI>Implements the ec.e.db.RtDecodingManager interface. This interface
helps in decoding references to local and remote objects which are referenced
in the incoming message stream. It handles three party handoffs.</LI>

<LI>Handles the messages of the E protocol including envelopes, new classes,
registering/unregistering objects, and distributed garbage collection.</LI>

<LI>Uses the ec.e.db package to encode objects into envelopes and decode
them from envelopes.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>The TCP Interface layer (ec/e/net/RawConnection.java, ec/e/net/SendThread.java,
and ec/e/net/RecvThread.java) which:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Maintains 3 threads for each connection, a send thread, a receive thread,
and a control thread.</LI>

<LI>Encodes the record oriented messages of the other layers for TCP's
streem oriented transmission.</LI>

<LI>Performs encryption/decryption of the messages.</LI>

<LI>Generates a unique Initialization Value for use in encryption, and
to ensure messages are not replayed.</LI>

<LI>Generates and checks Message Authentication Codes (MACs) on each message
to ensure the messages are not being inserted by an attacker. (It also
ensures messages have not been altered in transmission.)</LI>

<LI>Maintains a queue of messages for transmission.</LI>

<LI>Collects multiple E protocol messages into one encryption block for
transmission.</LI>

<LI>Builds the TCP connection.</LI>

<LI>Receives messages from the TCP connection and passes them into the
vat.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Import/Export Tables</FONT></B></P>

<P><B>Encoding</B></P>

<P>If, while encoding an object, an object is encountered which is not
<TT>RtEncodeable</TT>, then <TT><A HREF="EncodeDecodeOverview.html">RtStandardEncoder</A></TT>
calls on <TT>MsgSender.encodeObject</TT> to encode the object. If the object
is not an instance of <TT>RtDeflector</TT>, then a proxy is created for
it on the remote vat. If it is an instance of <TT>RtDeflector</TT>, then
it is a proxy for a remote object which is either hosted on the remote
vat or on a third vat. All three cases are handled by the message type
<TT>RtCodingSystem.kcManagerEncoded</TT> which is written by <TT>RtStandardEncoder</TT>.
To manage proxys, the Msg layer has two tables, the <TT>ExportTable </TT>and
the <TT>ImportTable</TT>. </P>

<P>The <TT>ExportTable </TT>holds information about objects which have
been exported. Internally the <TT>ExportTable </TT>has <TT>Hashtables </TT>which
map <TT>exportID </TT>to <TT>EObjectExport </TT>and the local object to
<TT>exportID</TT>. The <TT>EObjectExport </TT>holds references to the local
object and the EConnection, and a touch count. The touch count is used
to avoid garbage collecting an object while a new reference is in-transit
between the vats. N.B. The <TT>exportID </TT>is the Swiss number.</P>

<P>The <TT>ImportTable </TT>holds information about remote objects which
have local proxys. It has a <TT>Hashtable </TT>which relates exportIDs
to the local proxy objects.</P>

<P>If a proxy is to be sent to the remote vat, and the object has already
been exported to that vat, the <TT>exportID </TT>is retrieved from <TT>ExportTable
</TT>and the touch count for the object is incremented. If a new proxy
must be created, the <TT>ExportTable </TT>creates a new <TT>EObjectExport
</TT>places to appropriate entries in the two hash tables. In either case,
the <TT>exportID </TT>is sent to the remote vat with an indication that
this is an <TT>OUTBOUND_ID</TT>.</P>

<P>If the local object is a proxy and refers to an object in the remote
vat, then the <TT>importID </TT>is sent with an indication that this is
an <TT>INBOUND_ID</TT>. Otherwise a three party handoff is performed by
sending the <TT>exportID </TT>(which is the Swiss number), the <TT>registrarID
</TT>and PLS search path for the vat which holds the object along with
an indication that this is an <TT>HANDOFF_ID</TT>.</P>

<P><B>Decoding</B></P>

<P>When RtStandardDecoder is decoding a serialized object, and it finds
an encoding type of <TT>RtCodingSystem.kcManagerEncoded </TT>it calls <TT>MsgReceiver
</TT>to decode the object. <TT>MsgReceiver </TT>uses the ID written by
<TT>MsgSender </TT>to determine its course of action.</P>

<P>If the ID is <TT>INBOUND_ID</TT>, then the other vat has a proxy and
this end has the object. The object is fetched from the local ExportTable
and and used as the local decoded object.</P>

<P>If the ID is <TT>OUTBOUND_ID</TT>, then <TT>MsgReceiver </TT>checks
the <TT>ImportTable </TT>to see if there is already a proxy for that object.
If there is, it is used as the local decoded object. Otherwise a new proxy
is created, entered into the <TT>ImportTable</TT>, and used as the local
decoded object.</P>

<P>If the ID is <TT>HANDOFF_ID</TT>, then <TT>MsgReceiver </TT>gets an
<TT>EConnection </TT>object for the third vat. (N.B. This <TT>EConnection
</TT>object may not be actually connected to the third vat.) It checks
the third vat's <TT>ImportTable </TT>to see if a proxy already exists for
the object. If the proxy already exists, then it is used. Otherwise a new
proxy is registered in the <TT>ImportTable </TT>for the third vat, and
a <TT>EXPORT_OBJECT_REQUEST</TT> message is sent to the third vat. (N.B.
This message is queued until the a connection is built if the third vat's
<TT>EConnection </TT>is not already connected. </P>

<P>When the third vat receives the <TT>EXPORT_OBJECT_REQUEST</TT>&nbsp;message,
it uses the registrarID of the vat initiating the handoff to locate the
object in that <TT>EConnection</TT>'s <TT>ExportTable </TT>and registers
it in the current connection as an exported object. It then sends an <TT>EXPORT_OBJECT_REPLY</TT>
message to the vat receiving the handoff. </P>

<P><B>The Listen Stack</B> </P>

<P>The listen stack parallels the structure of the connections. The r167
system has two instances of the listen stack, one to listen for comm connections
from other vats, and the other to listen for notifications that some local
user action (e.g. clicking on a .mcm file in a browser) needs to be handled.
</P>

<P>The listen stack has two threads, the ListenThread which runs as a daemon,
and the UserThread. The ListenThread needs to be a daemon thread because
as a user thread, it would be uninterruptable while it is waiting on an
accept(). (This is due to a bug in Solaris.) However, as a daemon thread,
the application can exit while it is still running. We don't want to exit
while waiting for connections (and not doing anything else), so we have
the UserThread which does nothing but wait. Since it is a user thread,
it keeps the application from exiting, and since it is not waiting on an
accept(), we can kill it. When we tell the ListenThread to shutdown, which
we can do because it is a daemon thread, it sends a notify() to the UserThread
which then shuts down. Hallelujah! </P>

<P>When a new connection arrives, the ListenThread (ec/e/net/ListenThread.java)
builds a new TCP interface layer and passes it to the MsgListener (ec/e/net/MsgListener.java).
The MsgListener builds a new Msg layer which engages in the connection
startup protocol. The EListener (ec/e/net/EListener.java) is only used
to handle errors and during vat startup/shutdown. </P>

<H4><FONT SIZE=+2>Proposed Architecture Overview</FONT></H4>

<P>TBD </P>

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>

<P>We may want to replace the encryption, and authentication in the TCP
layer with SSL. See <A HREF="SSLvsEComm.html">SSL vs. E Comm</A> for an
analysis. </P>

<P>My (wsf) own opinion is that we should only do this if there are significant
advantages from the change, since the current code seems to work reasonably
well and there are significant differences in the symantic model. Possible
advantages of SSL are more supported crypto algorthms, and better crypto
vetting because it is a published protocol. I don't think SSL will help
with our Firewall problems. </P>

<P>It might be valuable to model our implementation on the Baltimore Technologies
implementation. I (wsf) would be more convinced if several other implementations
had substantially the same implementation structure. </P>

<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>

<P>This code uses multiple threads to overlap communication with computation,
so it must be designed to be thread safe. </P>

<P><I>Lists any special objectives and assumptions of the code e.g. reusability,
thread safety, security, performance, use of resources, compatibility with
existing code etc. This section gives important context for reviewers</I>
</P>

<H2>Current implementation</H2>

<P>See current architecture above.&nbsp; See also <A HREF="CommSystemXref_r167.html">External
Interface for ec.e.net in r167</A> which shows which methods are referenced
from outside the package. </P>

<H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>

<P>ec4/javasrc/ec/e/net holds the source for this package. </P>

<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>

<P>The code is partially JavaDoc'ed. Since some classes use the foo &lt;-
blah form of Esend, javadoc barfs in processing them. </P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P>None </P>

<H4>Testing and Debugging</H4>

<P><I>(Optional) Lists any tests and debugging utilities which are to be
developed to help test the design (e.g. test classes, trace categories,
etc)</I> </P>

<H2>Design Issues</H2>

<H4>Resolved Issues</H4>

<P><I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I> </P>

<H4>Open Issues</H4>

<P><I>This section of the document is used by the authors and moderator
to store any incomplete information - issues identified during a design
inspection but not yet resolved (the task list), notes that aren't ready
to be put into the main text, etc.</I> </P>

<P>Does LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) have any application
to our PLS requirements?<BR>

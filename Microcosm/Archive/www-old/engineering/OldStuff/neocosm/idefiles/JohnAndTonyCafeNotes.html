I'm Changing the format of this section to be a current working version of
*someone's* sc.ini file, followed by our comments.

<H3>Notes</H3>

<p><b>John</b> <i>2/24/98:</i><br>
I added the following lines to my ECEnvironment.bat in order to allow running
Appearance2DEditor.java from the command line:
<br>
<br>    set SWING_HOME=C:\mine\swing-1.0
<br>    set CLASSPATH=%SWING_HOME%;%SWING_HOME%\swing.jar;%SWING_HOME%\windows.jar;%SWING_HOME%\motif.jar;%SWING_HOME%\jlf.jar;%SWING_HOME%\mac.jar;%SWING_HOME%\1.1_libs\swing.jar;%SWING_HOME%\1.1_libs\windows.jar;%SWING_HOME%\1.1_libs\motif.jar;%SWING_HOME%\1.1_libs\jlf.jar;%SWING_HOME%\1.1_libs\mac.jar;%CLASSPATH%

<p>Since swing-1.0 isn't yet in the EC directory with our other third-party
libraries,the SWING_HOME line specifies where I've put it on my local disk.
Eventually we'll standardize this in EC/TP.</p>


<p><b>John</b> <i>2/24/98:</i><br>
I checked in a GNUmakefile but it doesn't work, because the classpath it
uses doesn't include the swing stuff. The classpath environment
variable, set from ECEnvironment.bat, does include the swing stuff (as
described above). This is probably related to the funky way we assemble
classpaths on the fly to handle crew/steward/guest distinctions. For the
moment, you have to compile in Visual Cafe, but you can then run from
the command line if you want.</p>


<p><b>John</b> <i>2/24/98:</i><br>
If I specify a package (ec.cosm.tools.appearance) at the top of
Appearance2DEditor.java, it builds but then can't find the class file to
run. I tried both "Appearance2DEditor" and
"ec.cosm.tools.appearance.Appearance2DEditor" as the name of the class
in the Options dialog in the Project window; both gave the same
unhelpful error message. For now, all the class files just get dumped
into the directory with the source code, which is obviously lame. It
would be nice to get the class files into the same place they go when
building with GNUmakefile (if that worked!), but I don't yet know how to
do that.</p>

<p><b>Followup from John</b> <i>2/27/98:</i><br>
To make the classes go into our classfiles hierarchy, you've got to
specify the output directory in Visual Cafe's Project/options dialog.
Choose that menu item, then click the Directory tab, then select "Output
files" from the combo box. Here enter the root for our classfiles
hierarchy (e.g. "C:\Build\classes"). Now under the Project tab in this
same window type in the fully-qualified class name as the Main Class
(e.g., "ec.cosm.tools.appearance.Appearance2DEditor").</p>

<p><b>John</b> <i>3/11/98</i><br>
The Main Class has been changed to ec.cosm.tools.appearance.AppearanceTool.</p>

sc.ini notes:</p>
<OL>
<LI>I've simplified the SWING_PATH considerably after reading *their*
readme.txt.  The SWING_PATH now just points to swingall.jar</LI>
<LI>I've enlarged the PATH considerably to include our entire build
environment path. This is to ensure that we pick up any DLLs
(appearance.dll, notably) I could pare this down some to just include the
relevant lib directories, but this is a start.</LI>
<LI>Started to put comments in the .ini file itself. Preceded with a pound (#)</LI>

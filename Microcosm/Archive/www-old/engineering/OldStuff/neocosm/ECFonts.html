Introduction</H2>
ECFonts is the code that is used to create the text that appears in-world -
text-balloons, labels, and hints. There are two parts to it: The Java API,
and the underlying native code that actually generates the bitmaps that get
passed into the renderer.

<H2>
Requirements</H2>

The ECFonts subsystem (called 'FastFonts' at cosm startup) was created
to address the need for text balloons, and custom text in-world. Although 
plain Java text could be used, AWT's text support is very primitive and 
there's no mechanism for 'balloons'. Our text also has some further
customization like outlines around the letters and and so on. <p>


A functionally equivalent replacement font subsystem would have to: <br><br>
<ul>
<li> Handle multiple fonts. We use, at least, plain and italic Verdana.
<li> Handle arbitrary width word wrapping. </li>
<li> Be able to outline the text. We use a 2 pixel wide outline.</li>
<li> Allow the foreground and the outline colors of the text to be specified.</li>
<li> Be able to generate the 6 balloon styles: Speak, Think, Shazam,
     Square, Sing, and Octagon.
     </li>
<li> Allow the foreground and background colors of the balloon to be 
     specified. </li>
<li> Be able to underline arbitrary pieces of a string. </li>
<li> Be able to generate text balloons quickly enough to keep up with a 
     fast typist.</li>
<li> Not leak memory. :-) </li>
<li> Create TexturedObjects (eg. WidgetPolygons) suitable for use with 
     the renderer. </li>
</ul>


<H2>
Architecture</H2>


<H4> Current Architecture Overview</H4>
As I mentioned earlier, there are two main parts to the ECFonts stuff:
The API, and the underlying native code where most of the work is done. <p>

The API portion is responsible for calling into the native code
(which allocs native memory) to create bitmaps, generating Textures and 
WidgetPolygons you'd probably want to create a WidgetPolygon or other 
TexturedObject suitable for passing into the renderer so it can be 
displayed on the screen. To create the WidgetPolygon, you'd call
ECText.getPoly(), and the result will be a WidgetPolygon with the 
bitmap of your text string applied to it.


<H4>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>
<I>This section is not urgent for the first version of this document, you
should capture what direction you feel this subsystem ought to take. As
we start addressing specific systems this section will grow into the core
of the design document.</I>
<H4>
Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
If we're looking for the same look, there are no off-the-shelf alternatives.
However, if we're just looking for some way to get text in-world, we could
use whatever built in text support Java (or AWT, or JFC, or...) has - though
there would be some need to convert things to bitmaps, etc. <p>


<H4>
Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
<ul>
<li>The code needs to be fast. A new text balloon (2 bitmaps leading to
    2 textures and 2 polygons) is created for every new character in
    a string when a user is typing. Any delay here is very noticeable.
<li>The code shouldn't eat much memory, for overall footprint reasons.
<li>We need to be able to handle, or at least not preclude handling,
    UniCode fonts for localization purposes.
</ul>

<H2>
Current implementation</H2>

To use ECFonts, you need to know about the following Java classes: <p>

<table border>
 <tr>
 <td>ECFont</td>
 <td>One of our supported fonts. When you create one of these, you pass
     in the name of the font you want (eg. "verdana13") to the constructor.
     If that font is available, the returned ECFont object will represent
     it. If that font isn't available, the returned ECFont object will
     represent the default font (which happens to be "verdana13").
     </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>ECText</td>
 <td>A single text string. Text can be outlined, colored, underlined, or
     have different fonts (these attributes are specified via arcane
     control characters embedded in the string itself). Once the ECText
     object is created, you can call getTexture() to create and return a 
     Texture object (created from the bitmap of the string) or getPoly()
     to get create and return a WidgetPolygon textured with the bitmap
     of the string.
     
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>TextBalloonStyle</td>
 <td>A static class containing handles to the 6 available balloon styles:
     Speak, Think, Shazam, Square, Sing, and Octagon. You reference
     the styles via the static class, as in "TextBalloonStyle.singTBS()".
     
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>TextBalloon</td>
 <td>A "balloon" of text, created using a specified TextBalloonStyle,
     a specified string, and a specified ECFont or array of ECFonts.
     As with an ECText object, you can call getPolys() or getTextures()
     to create and return objects suitable for passing to the renderer.
     A given TextBalloon will have either 2 or 4 polygons/textures,
     depending on whether quips were specified. Un-quipped TextBalloons
     return a translucent background balloon and an opaque foreground
     balloon. Quipped TextBalloons return two of those pairs, one with
     quips and one without.
 </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<br>
The native code handles the grunt work - tasks like the laying out of
text, computing sizes of strings, handling word wrap, underlining,
copying bitmaps, drawing the borders of balloons. All of that is done
natively for speed. <p>
The available fonts are also represented in native code. Again, for
speed reasons, we pre-process (once per font) a given TrueType font
into a format that we can use quickly at runtime. There is a standalone
utility (FontGenerator, a horrible hack) that lets you choose any
TrueType font installed on your system, pick a size and style, and 
create our proprietary intermediate format. This format takes the 
form of static C data structures (representing 1-bit bitmaps of the 
glyphs) and is written out into a C source file. Look at any of the
ECnFontXXXNN.c files, which were generated by this tool. (internally,
all this tool does is walk the font, rendering each glyph into a 1-bit
bitmap, and then writes that bitmap into a C byte array as static 
initializer data). FontGenerator only needs to be run when you want
to add another font to the system.  The generated source file is 
then checked into CVS, and Bob's your uncle.
<p>
Currently, our supported fonts are as follows. Look in FFLayout.cpp
to see how they're enabled (and how to add another one).
<pre>
    "Verdana13"        small verdana (the default)
    "Verdana14"        slightly bigger verdana
    "Verdana16"        large verdana
    "VerdanaItalic14"  small italic verdana
    "VerdanaItalic16"  large italic verdana
    "GLYPH17"          our special font, containing our icons
    "GLYPH19"          large special font, containing our icons
</pre>

Let's say you're trying to create a text balloon. The overall path
would go something like this:
<pre>
    You'd create a new TextBalloon, passing it a font, a string, maybe
    a width, maybe some flags telling it not to make quips, and the
    colors it should use. There are multiple constructors available,
    see TextBalloon.java for details.
    
    TextBalloon myBalloon = 
       new TextBalloon(new ECFont("Verdana13"),
                       "This is a sample string.",
                       TextBalloonStyle.singTBS(), // make a sing balloon
                       TextBalloon.TB_NO_QUIPS,    // with no quips
                       400,                        // 400 pixels wide
                       Color.white,                // white text
                       Color.black,                // with black outline
                       Color.red,                  // on red bordered balloon
                       Color.blue                  // with a blue background
                       );

    At this point, you'd have a TextBalloon object. This doesn't really
    help you if you want to display it on the screen. To do that, you'd
    need a Texture that you could apply to a Polygon, or even just a 
    pre-textured Polygon. Fortunately for you, the TextBalloon object
    can create them for you!

    Note that at this time, very little actual work has been done. For
    the most part, the TextBalloon object has just done some sanity
    checking and kept track of your specification but has not done any 
    actual layout. Thus, creating TextBalloon objects is pretty cheap.

    So, to get a WidgetPolygon suitable for handing to the renderer,
    you simply call getPolygons():

    WidgetPolygons myPolys = myBalloon.getPolys();

    At this point, a lot happens. TextBalloon drops down into native
    code, where it goes about walking the text string looking for
    control characters and so on. It computes how big a bitmap it'll
    need to lay the string out, malloc's the bitmap, and proceeds to
    lay the string out. During the layout, it handles word wrapping,
    underlining, switching of fonts, etc. Once the initial layout is
    done, it has to outline the text. To do this, it walks each byte
    in the text bitmap it just created, and figures out where to
    draw so the outline comes out. 

    At this point, it's got a bitmap of outlined text. If you had
    created just an ECText object, it would stop here. But, since
    you're making a balloon, it needs to do some more work.

    First, it looks up the balloon style you handed in. Then it looks
    at the size of the text bitmap it just created, and figures out
    how big a balloon it'll need to make to go around the text bitmap.
    It malloc's that, and proceeds to draw the balloon.  The balloon
    styles are similar to the fonts in that their specified as static
    stipples. The code that draws the balloon bitmaps knows how to 
    create a balloon of any size (modulo stipple size), and also
    knows how to add quips. 

    There are at least two bitmaps created per balloon. Four, if 
    quips were also requested. The reason for the multiple bitmaps
    is that the balloon background is translucent. The renderer
    doesn't know how to mix translucency and opacity in one texture,
    so we create two textures. At render time (usually in the Dynamics
    Engine or in Claire's BalloonKeyHandler), the opaque balloon is
    drawn on top of the translucent balloon, giving the impresssion 
    of one balloon with a solid border around a translucent background.
    When quips are requested, two more bitmaps are created for the same
    reason - except that they have quips.

    So, the native code finishes creating the bitmaps it wants to
    create, and stores their handles (addresses) in the TextBalloon
    class that called the native code. It accesses the Java int's
    in the class directly via the JNI. This way, the TextBalloon
    object can be passed around and can always get to it's native
    memory. Also, when the TextBalloon object is destroyed, its
    finalize method calls the native code to free the malloc'd bitmaps.

    Once the bitmaps are created, the native code returns and you're
    back in Java land. The TextBalloon code then creates Textures
    (via some more native code in the renderer's area) out of the
    bitmaps. If you called TextBalloon.getTextures(), it will return
    these Textures. If you called TextBalloon.getPolys(), it will
    create new WidgetPolygons and apply the Textures to them.
    Either way, you end up with a Java object suitable for use
    with the renderer.

Design Issues</H2>

<H4>
Resolved Issues</H4>
The original implementation of the ECFonts stuff was done in Java. This
proved to be MUCH too slow, since most of the work is byte manipulation 
and fills. Thus, it was rewritten in C.
<H4>
Open Issues</H4>
Some open issues: 
<ul>
<li>There are some hardcoded limits in the code (FF_MAX_LINES_PER_BALLOON, 
    FF_MAX_FONTS_PER_STRING). The clamping code should be re-checked
    for robustness.
<li>Cut+Paste was supposed to be supported, but never got implemented. 
    There is some preliminary mouse-tracking logic in place, but that's all.
<li>There is a bad pixel or two in the Sing balloon, just under the music
    note.
<li>ECFonts was designed so as not to preclude the ability to choose a
    font at runtime. However, this piece of the code hasn't been added.
    It wouldn't be hard to do, though.
<li>ECFonts does everything with 16-bit characters so as not to preclude
    plugging in a UNICODE font, but this hasn't been tested.
<li>The code could use a serious review. Much of it was done fairly
    quickly, and I'm sure there are a few eyebrow raisers in it. In
    particular, I think it could use a review with an eye toward failure
    handling. On the other hand, it's been basically untouched since it
    went in, so it's pretty stable.
<li>
    I just remembered that there are two places where using a memcpy()
    would possibly help performance. It's in the portion of the native
    code that copies an unquipped balloon bitmap onto a new bitmap in
    preparation for adding the quip. Currently, I do all byte copies
    by walking a pointer - probably memcpy() is better optimized for
    the sizes of memory we're walking. In any case, it's not a bottleneck,
    so no big thing.
</li>
</ul>

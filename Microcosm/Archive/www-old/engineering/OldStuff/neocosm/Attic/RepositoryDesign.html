<H3><A HREF="mailto:randy@communities.com">Randy</A>'s Original Spec</H3>

<H4>[15 June 1998]</H4>

<H4>Requirements</H4>

<ul>
<li>Provide for retrieval of certified objects
	<ul>
	<li>transmission of certificate info to <u>"server"/region</u>
	<li>global unique identification of objects (currently cryptohash)
	</ul>
<li>Transmit all data and certificates to others (data unpacking is recursive)
	<ul>
	<li>local caching system
	<li>3rd party hand off mechanism (federated "repository servers";
	hints; publication; URLs; ftp/http/whatever)
	<li>dynamic certification
	<li>certificate renewal (through "repository server")
	</ul>
<li>Support multiple repositories
<li>Allow asynchronous retrieval of data
<li>Allow dynamic policy tweaking (added during 6/15 meeting)
	<ul>
	<li>certificate agency should work with "repository server"
	</ul>
</ul>

<H4>Desires</H4>

<ul>
<li>"Tweakable" policies for order of repository searching
	<ul>
	<li>follow hints first
	<li>ask user first
	<li>check with "region"/server first
	</ul>
<li>Handling of "group" requests (grab all pieces of an appearance as one
block of data, for example)
<li>Actually implementing all the downloading via hints stuff
</ul>

<H3><A HREF="mailto:bob@communities.com">Bob</A>'s &
    <A HREF="mailto:bill@communities.com">Bill</A>'s Ideas</H3>

<H4>[12(?) June 1998]</H4>

<H4>High Level Design</H4>

<ul>
<li>Repositories are simple databases (cryptohash -> bytes)
	<ul>
	<li>deal with one source (file or directory)
	<li>enter this data with this cryptohash
	<li>get me the data for this cryptohash
	<li>open a stream for this cryptohash (for adding large files)
	<li>get me a stream for this cryptohash (for fetching large files)
	</ul>
<li>Repository (or Resource) managers handle higher level functionality
	<ul>
	<li>caching stuff that's been looked up before (and possibly "cooked" in some way)
	<li>allowing explicit fetching of original (uncached and/or "uncooked") data
	<li>handling multiple directories (repositories)
	<li>linking two repositories via the stream interface for copying data
	<li>dealing with following hints?
	</ul>
<li>Production interface provides name lookup support
	<ul>
	<li>name -> cryptohash -> bytes
	<li>name -> file system -> bytes
	</ul>
</ul>

<H4>Ideas</H4>

<ul>
<li>Repository is an interface which files and managers
would implement; managers would also do more.
<li>RepositoryOfLastResort could be a special implementation that has no actual
data, but merely follows hints.
</ul>

<H4>[16 June 1998]</H4>

<H4>High Level Design</H4>

<ul>
<li>interface <b>Repository</b>
	<ul>
	<li>getting and puting data (bits) by key (cryptohash)
	<li>reading and writing data streams by key
	<li>getting and puting hints by key
	<li>getting and puting certificates by key
	<li>getting and puting <A HREF="RepositoryRequirements.html#StringNameSupport">string names</A> of original files by key?
	<li>getting and puting <A HREF="RepositoryRequirements.html#ExtraInfo">extra info</A> (author, object type, date submitted, size. etc/) by key?
	<li>deleting items and compacting the repository for <A HREF="RepositoryRequirements.html#Speedy">speedy</A> updates?
	</ul>
<li>class <b>RepositoryFile</b>
	<ul>
	<li>implements <b>Repository</b>
	<li>contains a table of data
	<li>contains a table of hints
	<li>contains a table of certificates
	</ul>
<li>class <b>RepositoryManager</b>
	<ul>
	<li>implements <b>Repository</b>
	<li>handles multiple <b>Repositor</b>ies
	<li>provides caching of previously looked up data (or should this be part
	of the <b>Repository</b> interface?)
	<li>provides mechanism for streaming from one repository into another
	<li>provides mechanism for defining lookup protocols (local first, hints first, etc.)
	</ul>
<li>interface <b>RepositoryProducer</b> (read "put" as "replace")
	<ul>
	<li>getting and puting data (bits) by name
	<li>reading and writing data streams by name
	<li>getting and puting hints by name?
	<li>getting and puting certificates by name?
	<li>getting and puting text files (which are then "compiled" into data) by name?
	<li>writing out a RepositoryFile
	<li>updating (faster than writing a whole new one) a RepositoryFile?
	</ul>
</ul>

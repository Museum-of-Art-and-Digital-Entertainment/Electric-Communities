<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Repositories hold the descriptions of the two and three dementional
objects which make up an EC world. Distributing new repositories is the
primary way of distributing new art.</P>

<P><I>(Optional) list any related design documents</I> </P>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Allow multiple, uncoordinated sources of art.</LI>

<LI>Allow ad hoc art down load from multiple possible sources.</LI>

<LI>Allow for local caching of downloaded art.</LI>

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<P><I>Diagrams are strongly encouraged; a few diagrams can do wonders for
clairifying an architecture. If you don't know how to add diagrams consult
Lani and Amy.</I> </P>

<H4>Current Architecture Overview</H4>

<P><I>The introduction set the scene; this section gives the key properties
of the current design. It may mention classes and some important interfaces
but it doesn't go into details. Someone should be able to read just the
overviews of our design documents and get a good understanding of how the
system works and fits together, without knowing the full details.</I> <I>Also
include any insights gained from experience like design bugs or expense
discovered in usage.</I> </P>

<H4>Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>

<P><I>This section is not urgent for the first version of this document,
you should capture what direction you feel this subsystem ought to take.
As we start addressing specific systems this section will grow into the
core of the design document.</I> </P>

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>

<P><I>Any notes about potential off the shelf technologies that could be
used, and their trade-offs.</I> </P>

<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>

<P>Current implementationDataHolders were designed to be capability secure
in a Vat. At the moment the implementation is neither entirely capability
secure (since the actual implementation has a couple known capability leaks)
nor streamlined (since some simpler solutions were initially ruled out
for capability reasons). I'd like to worry about these issues again once
the code works.</P>

<P>Note that the description below was written before &quot;forwarding
SturdyRefs&quot; so no mention is made of them. The code has been revised
to handle these but the description below is inaccurate about these details.</P>

<P>I'd still like to hear if anyone can see a better solution than what
I have attempted to implement.</P>

<P>The operations labeled DataHolder use #1 and DataHolder use #2 below
are working (quite reliably) in the alpha release. It's just the third
case that is tricky, but it is an important case to us.</P>

<P>========================================================</P>

<P>Remote Art Download The contained dataholder problem</P>

<P>This memo attempts to explain why DataHolders containing DataHolders
are so hard to download.</P>

<P>In an effort to make this memo self-contained I've attempted to briefly
describe all terms before using them even if this meant making the memo
quite a bit longer.</P>

<P>DataHolder</P>

<P>DataHolders are lightweight objects that identify large static objects
that convey no authority, such as bitmaps and Appearance2D and Appearance3D
objects.</P>

<P>The DataHolder interface is implemented by the ec.e.hold.DataHolderSteward
class. A DataHolderSteward contains an instance of class CryptoHash (which
determines what large object the DataHolder represents) and a reference
to a Fulfiller, which is the capability to extract the data from the local
Repository, or from another machine on the network.</P>

<P>The main reason for not keeping the capability for data retrieval in
the DataHolder itself is one of economy. Most objects in a region will
share the same data source and sharing the Fulfiller makes the DataHolders
smaller and cuts down on network traffic.</P>

<P>SuperRepository</P>

<P>A SuperRepository is an object that manages several Repository files
for the purpose of running a large application such as Habi* - It opens
all Repository files in ECHome/{Dist,Extras,Publish,Cache,Cert}, allows
caching in the currently open Cache file, and allows the saving of certificates
in a specialized Certificate Repository using the object CryptoHash as
a key.</P>

<P>ParimeterizedRepository</P>

<P>A ParimeterizedRepository is a restriction of SuperRepository that allows
data retrieval from the SuperRepositopry or the net, and caching of downloaded
data, but does not allow writing to an arbitrary file (Repository or otherwise).
It also allows decoding objects using Parimeterization (Explained below).</P>

<P>Fulfiller</P>

<P>The retrieval capability object for the DataHolder, the Fulfiller, contains
a reference to the local ParimeterizedRepository, a Perimeter hashtable
to decode the object with, and a Hints Vector:</P>

<P>Hints Vector</P>

<P>This is an instance of Vector that contains unspecified hints objects
that allow one policy component, the RemoteDownloader, to find data on
the net if the data cannot be found locally by the SuperRepository. Note
that the format of the Vector is unspecified to allow future enhancements.
Today we foresee using either SturdyRef's (pointing to a RepositoryPublisher
object on some remote machine, from where you can request the data to be
downloaded given a CryptoHash object) or Strings (URL's and URL fragments
of a web server or servers somewhere that publishes (with high bandwidth)
the artwork for widely distributed objects).</P>

<P>Note that the URL based downloading is not yet implemented.</P>

<P>The Hints Vector is a Vector since the data may be available in more
than one place and the Vector allows you to look for it in several of these
places, sequentially or in parallel.</P>

<P>Where do DataHolders come from</P>

<P>DataHolders are typically handed to you by the comm system when you
enter a region (The region data structure contains Appearance objects etc
that contain DataHolders) or when some avatar or object enters the region
you are currently in. The server probably does not ever request the artwork
for the dataholders (since it won't need to display any objects) but all
GUI based users will request the DataHolder to give them the actual bits
they stand for using one of two calls: the synchronous held() call returns
the data immediately or fails (without attempting the network retrieve)
and the asynchronous giveDataTo(recipient) call that accepts the data whenever
it may arrive using a callback method. In what follows we will assume that
the asynchronous giveDataTo() call is used, whenever it matters.</P>

<P>DataHolder use #1 - local</P>

<P>The Fulfillers always first look in the local Repository for any DataHolder's
contents. It may exist in some Repository, and/or it may have been downloaded
previously and cached in the ECHome/Cache directory. The Fulfiller retrieves
it and decodes it. If anything goes wrong, then some error is normally
thrown. One typical such error is that the data is not available locally
and the hints vector is null or empty.</P>

<P>A note about the PublishRepository</P>

<P>A Publishing DataHolder is one that has a special Fulfiller that contains
a non-empty Hints vector, identifying the local RepositoryPublisher with
a SturdyRef.</P>

<P>There exists a Repository folder named ECHome/Publish that is managed
by the SuperRepository using a subclass of Repository named PublishRepository.</P>

<P>Things can get published in one of two ways:</P>

<P>1. User imports a swatch using the Swatch catalog. The imported swatch
artwork bitmap is encoded and stored in the PublishRepository using a specific
SuperRepository API call, which returns a Publishing DataHolder.</P>

<P>2. User can place a whole (externally curated) RepositoryFile in the
PublishRepository folder.</P>

<P>In the future we will likely have world creation tools that do this
without exposing Repository folders to the users.</P>

<P>Upon startup, and when publishing a new object using the Publishing
API of SuperRepository we check whether we have data to publish and don't
already have a running RepositoryPublisher, in which case we start one
and create a SturdyRef for it, which we save in a known place.</P>

<P>Now, as a special case in the code, (almost a Hack) when we decode a
DataHolder from the Repository (DataHolders have their own decoding recipe)
we check if the data came from PublishRepository. If so, we improve the
Hints Vector in the Fulfiller by adding our RepositoryPublisher SturdyRef
to it.</P>

<P>There's no way to do this at curation time (like putting the SturdyRef
into the Repository) since the SturdyRef for the publisher is not created
until after you start the publisher. This MUST be done at runtime, when
creating a region that one intends to serve.</P>

<P>This technique makes all DataHolders in a hosted region have either
null hints vectors (if the data is not published anywhere) or a hints vector
containing at least a sturdyref to the RepositoryPublisher of this host.
If the object was donwloaded we may be adding to an existing hints vector
rather than creating one but the details here are not crystal clear to
me at the moment and need some verification.</P>

<P>DataHolder use #2 - Simple remote download</P>

<P>If the data cannot be found locally, and if a Hints vector exists, then
the hints are examined in some specified order to determine where to attempt
an art download from. In the simplest case, the first element of the Hints
Vector is a SturdyRef to a RepositoryPublisher on another machine, such
as the server that hosts the region containing the object/avatar/etc with
the unavailable artwork.</P>

<P>When SuperRepository detects this situation it hands the DataHolder
and the hints Vector to the RemoteDownloader, which analyzes the hints
Vector and (in the case of a SturdyRef) creates an EDataRequestor object
to handle the actual download.</P>

<P>Note: It has been suggested that we should not use an E message to download
the data. This would be the place to call upon some other method to do
the download. However, let's continue following the current implementation
to the end.</P>

<P>EDataRequestor resolves the SturdyRef to a remote object and sends it
an E message requesting the data. If the remote object has the data, then
it will fill in a byte array of the undecoded byte data (thus saving a
decode and an encode in the remote SuperRepository end).</P>

<P>These bytes (or the failure exception, if something went wrong) are
sent directly to the original Fulfiller that requested the transaction.
This Fulfiller is the only component that not only knows what incoming
data that belongs to what outstanding request but it also has the PerimeterTables
for the decoding of the byte data in the requesting environment.</P>

<P>A note about Perimeter tables</P>

<P>When encoding a deep graph of objects over the wire or into the Repository
you need to know when to stop encoding - otherwise you would everything
reachable from the encoded object, potentially the whole world. The way
we handle this is that we create, before calling the encoding method, a
Hashtable of objects on the perimeter of the graph we want to encode. As
an example, suppose we want to encode a prop in a region. If we simply
encode the prop, then we'll end up encoding the whole region when following
the prop's reference to its container. But if we put the Region object
in the Perimeter table, then the Region object is encoded only as a named
placeholder for the actual region. Similarly we want to put the SuperRepository
into the Perimeter table to prevent all of its data structures from being
encoded whenever we encode a Fulfiller.</P>

<P>Then at the decode end, the Region and the SuperRepository will be replaced
with the region and SuperRepository in the *receiving* environment. This
is how we give the Fulfillers the SuperRepository capability on over-the-wire
decode.</P>

<P>Note: These placeholders are currently simple Strings. This is an oversight
- they should be a distinct object type containing said String, for security
reasons. This is a trivial but Repository-breaking change that I've been
postponing for a while.</P>

<P>A note about Appearance objects</P>

<P>Appearance Objects describe our animatable props and avatars to the
dynamics engine. These are quite expensive to construct so we construct
these in the curator when creating the Repository (henceforth referred
to as &quot;at curation time&quot;). Then, when starting a server with
a region we essentially just decode the appearance objects from the Repository
when constructing the Region according to the instructions in the RealmText
file.</P>

<P>Appearance objects are designed to not changed at runtime. Even an operation
as complex as swatching will leave the Appearance object intact (I've been
told).</P>

<P>These appearance objects contain many references to the bitmaps that
it needs. These are resolved from symbols to cryptohashes (using a symbol
table lookup at curation time) and from these cryptohashes we create our
DataHolders and save the whole appearance graph (with DataHolders at the
leaves) into the Repository.</P>

<P>Now we are getting close to the problem: When storing the appearance
object into the Repository we create a top-level DataHolder to hold our
entire encoded Repository-stored Appearance object. This saves lots of
network traffic since the entire appearance object can be sent as a small
DataHolder over the wire and decoded from the local Repository in the receiving
end at much lower cost. This is a BIG win for the normal case where both
region host and client have these objects in local Repositories but it
gets us in trouble with remote art downloading:</P>

<P>DataHolder use #3 - Appearance Objects</P>

<P>If someone receives a DataHolder to an Appearance object, then it is
looked up as usual in the Repository, and if it exists, it's decoded and
used. Now when the Dynamics engine sees the DataHolders at the leaves of
the Appearance object, it just requests those, and can typically get its
bitmaps from the Repository.</P>

<P>If the top-level DataHolder to the Appearance object does not exist
locally, then we can attempt to download it from the remote server. If
it has a hints vector with a sturdyref we request the bits from the remote
RepositoryPublisher identified by the SturdyRef.</P>

<P>These bits arrive as a byte array, which the Fulfiller decodes. We are
decoding an appearance object containing DataHolders. These &quot;contained
DataHolders&quot; have references to a fulfiller that was created at curation
time (typically by the user publishing this object with the new unique
artwork).</P>

<P>THESE FULFILLERS HAVE NO STURDYREFS to the remote RepositoryPublisher.</P>

<P>They cannot, since the Fulfillers were created at curation time and
encoded before the RepositoryPublisher even existed. Furthermore, they
were never decoded by the RepositoryPublisher - They were never anything
more than byte arrays in the publishing end - and thus never identified
as Fulfillers, so the Remote RepositoryPublisher cannot fix them up to
have hints with the correct SturdyRefs.</P>

<P>Since they have no SturdyRefs we cannot resolve them remotely. If they
don't exist in the local Repository, then we fail - We cannot find the
cel artwork to any contained DataHolder.</P>

<P>Possible solutions</P>

<P>I have considered several solutions to this dilemma and attempted to
implement a few of these. Let me describe some possible but rejected solutions,
and then describe others that could or have been implemented. Nothing I've
implemented has worked perfectly and it is hard to say how close we are
to a good solution to the problem.</P>

<P>1. Outlaw contained DataHolders. This would mean that appearance objects
would be sent over the wire as their actual data rather than as DataHolders.
This is unacceptable since it would severely increase network traffic.</P>

<P>2. Identify all items in the Repository that have contained DataHolders,
and when one is requested by RepositoryPublisher you decode them locally,
fix up the SturdyRefs, and re-encode the object. Now you cache the byte
array that resulted from this encode and whenever the PublishRepository
is asked for the object it will substitute the fixed-up version.</P>

<P>This sounded tricky so I tried something else first. It also sounds
slow at startup of a region containing published art. The marking of the
objects can be done at curation time (by adding some extra mark bit to
the Repository data structures) or at run time (by creating a look-aside
caching hashtable that maps cryptohashes to data. If the item has contained
dataholders then the data in the data is the fixed-up data, otherwise it's
the original data from the Repository. This run-time marking implies that
we keep much of a region's data in byte arrays in the publishing server,
which may require a lot of RAM.</P>

<P>One issue is that when you re-encode the object after fixing up the
SturdyRefs you will have a modified object with a different CryptoHash.
This complicates our security and certification stories.</P>

<P>Current implementation</P>

<P>The current implementation does not quite work. I have had most parts
of it work at one time or another but the interactions between components
on two machines with different repositories, the renderer, and Harry's
code for asynchronous redraw have complicated the process to the point
where this was extremely time consuming to debug. At a minimum I'd need
two machines on my desk to continue working on this (one can be slower
than the one I have).</P>

<P>What follows is written in a hurry without access to the actual code,
so there may be discrepancies.</P>

<P>The current implementation attempts to fix up the Hints vector in a
decoding recipe for class DataholderSteward.</P>

<P>The key to this scheme is that the Hints vector is put into the Perimeter
table for the Fulfiller at encode time by the Curator. This allows the
hints vector for any contained Fulfillers to be decoded containing adequate
hints.</P>

<P>The scheme should work recursively to any depth. Let's consider a top-level
dataholder at level 0 and its contained DataHolders at level 1. A renumbering
shows how this extends to any depth. I will continue to describe the simplest
two-level case.</P>

<P>Decoding the top-level DataHolder is still as easy as before in #2:</P>

<P>- We have a hints vector that is stored in a &quot;current Perimeter
table&quot; as &quot;Hints&quot;. This table also contains the SuperRepository
and possibly other capabilities.</P>

<P>- We retrieve the bytes for the data from local Repository or over the
net and decode them using the current Perimeter table.</P>

<P>- We extract the hints vector from the Fulfiller of the DataHolder we
just decoded. This is a crude operation since it breaks the encapsulation
of the Fulfiller and I'm looking into better ways to do this.</P>

<P>- We extend the hints vector in the current Perimeter table with this
decode hints vector. There's a method to do just this so we can implement
whatever policy we want here as long as local knowledge is enough.</P>

<P>We have now achieved that the Perimeter table contains the hints in
the surrounding environment and the hints in the top-level dataholder.
This is similar to local variables in a lexical scope and should in fact
be redesigned to behave more like that since I currently *may* have problems
when &quot;leaving scope&quot; and recursing upward (but maybe I did that
right, I don't have the code here).</P>

<P>Now when we decode the contained dataholders, the parimeterization of
&quot;Hints&quot; will cause the current hints vector to be substituted
in to every decoded fulfiller. These can now be fulfilled over the network.</P>

<P>One possible bug that I just thought of is that I don't know which order
things decode in. The updated hints may be decoded too late to help in
decoding the contained DataHolders. This needs to be split into a two-step
process if it is not one already but I think the Recipes will give me the
hook to do this.</P>

<P>Note that it easy to imagine a case where a contained DataHolder is
published by an entity different from the top-level dataholder. I believe
this is rare, and the alternatives look expensive.</P>

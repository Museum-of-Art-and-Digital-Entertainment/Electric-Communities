The Temporary PECO-At-EC Information Web Page</H2>
This page is an assemblage of all the PECO-related documents the Gang of
3 has run across.&nbsp; We encourage everyone who's interested in PECO
to examine these, to get a sense of the kind of process and product that
the PECO folks are discussing.&nbsp; Note that these are almost all informal
documents, with plenty of rough edges; that should give you an accurate
picture of the current early stage of things :-)

<P>They're in Word 97 or Excel 97 formats.&nbsp; You will need a Word 97
viewer to read these.&nbsp; You can upgrade your Word to Word97 from \\achilles\office97
(in the EC workgroup under Network Neighborhood) unless someone's taken
the CD out of the drive on achilles, so if you get "not available" then
<A HREF="mailto:robk@communities.com">ping RobK</A>. Or you can <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/word/internet/viewer/viewer97/">get
the free Word97 viewer</A> from Microsoft.&nbsp; (Thanks Jeff!)

<P>Otherwise <A HREF="mailto:robj@communities.com">ping RobJ</A> if some
link doesn't work because of some bizarre browser reason.&nbsp; (Tested
(and authored) under Netscape 4.0 and works OK there... thanks to the people
who told me about the broken filenames-with-spaces; that should be all
better now.)

<P>And, of course, <A HREF="mailto:eng_mgmt@communities.com">tell the gang
of 3</A> if you have any feedback on any of this, or if there's something
in particular you'd like to become more aware of or involved in.
<H3>

in the document, but an important feature) with him.</UL>

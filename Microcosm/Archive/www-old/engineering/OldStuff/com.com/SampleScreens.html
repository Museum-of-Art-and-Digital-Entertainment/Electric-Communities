<P>This sample screen is not a proposal for a specific interface. I created
it as a placeholder for completeness of technical design and review.

<P>The ECID interface is completely seperate [near the toolbar] from the
ComCom interface. This is because you might want to close ComCom, but keep
ECID running (serving up your ID info to your friends....) Also, some of
the marketing _scenarios_ do not include ComCom. The ECID interface is
acutally a native application that connects to ECID with an <A HREF="ECIDNetworkDiagram.html#A">ECID
interapplication connection</A>.<I></I>

<P><I>There are several features missing from these interfaces: ECID needs
a way to access the Backlist of People Watching. ComCom doesn't show a
Verify User option, doesn't have a Group monitor line, and none of the
"lightweight monitors" are shown.</I>

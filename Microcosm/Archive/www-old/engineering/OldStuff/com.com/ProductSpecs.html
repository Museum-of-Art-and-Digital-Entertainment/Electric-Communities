<P><B><I>ECID Specification</I></B>

<P><I>1.0 Introduction</I>

<P><U>ECID</U> (<U>E</U>lectric <U>C</U>ommunities <U>Id</U>entity) is
an identity system providing persistent, addressable, secure distributed
identities for Internet processes representing people, places and things.
ECIDs are globally unique without requiring the use of a central identity
server. They use a collection of Process Location Servers to resolve connections
from dynamic IP addresses. Process Location Servers can be public or private
and can reside anywhere on the Internet. ECID relies on secure, encrypted
communications between processes. Because it is decentralized, it can be
added to any existing application.

<P>With secure communications, all other applications can be associative
optional.

<P>ECID is used by end-users to manage only what you send out, not what
you are watching.

<P>ECID is used by organizations to manage and communicate with lists of
users who have visited a WWW site, registered for a WWW-site or application.

<P>ECID hands out capabilities.

Value: Aggregate population. Establish ground work for Game Companies to
get into multi-user games by providing them with authentication and back-ends
that scale to the rest of our technologies. Create a large-scale, relatively
low-risk test for our secure identities and secure communications claims
(low risk wrt to commerce, involvement in actual game economies, etc.).

<P>Offer ECID as an authentication scheme to Entertainment Companies. Aggregate
ECIDs by going after organizations who need identities, rather than individuals
in the ICQ tradition.

<P>Offer ECID code for people to add to their applications to give them
secure IDs.

<P><B>3.0 Strategic Relationships and Competition</B>

<P>VeriSign, Ichat, Eshare, InfoSeek, Yahoo, Microsoft, CyberGold, LiveWorld.

<P>Matt says that VeriSign and Microsoft want to become identity wallets.
He says that promoting a new identity system would be terribly expensive.

<P><B>4.0 Product Outline</B>

<P>ECID sub-systems
<DIR><I>ECID sturdy reference and process maker</I> – ??

<P><I>Process Location Server</I> – When a user connects to the Internet,
their ECID is automatically published to all of the Process Location Servers
where that ECID is listed. The PLS then broadcasts the online status of
this ECID to all processes that the ECID permits. Process Locations Servers
can be public or private and may be run behind firewalls. [Pull on name
to get info back about what PLS to call]

<P><I>ECID interface library</I> – The ECID interface library

<P><I>Granted capabilities interface</I> – The "granted capabilities" interface
resides in the client code and keeps track of the capabilities that have
been granted to others by the user. This allows users to keep track of
who is allowed to track each ECID that they possess.

<P><I>Certificates interface </I>– This interface resides in the client
code and keeps track of the certificates that the user has collected in
their travels around the Internet.

<P><I>Authentication interface</I> – This interface resides in the

<P><I>Back-end</I> – EC and other organizations that use ECID as an authentication
mechanism use the back-end to keep track of user ECIDs and other data they
may wish to collect. Includes data source for ECIDs and an exchange database
to tie ECIDs to other identity systems (does this piece go here or in ComCom?)</DIR>

<P><B>1.0 Introduction</B>

<P>ComCom is a low cost, always up tool to help users coordinate activities
between multiple people and places on the net in a secure fashion.

<P>ComCom provides a simple, low cost/always up interface for getting basic
information about what is going on in all the Internet contexts you frequent,
including all of EC's venues. Offers opportunities for advertising and
promotion of all virtual community and chat solutions. Provides value-added
for EC technologies. Spying can have low-cost lobby-like effects: I can
watch until my favorite partner comes to the Quake server and then I can
launch the game to play together. We aggregate global user statistics --
it serves a mega @where function to know what is going on in all sites.
We can know how many players are playing Quake, etc. The Spy Windows can
come pre-loaded with links to WWW pages to promote our products or the
products of our partners. It shows you how to download things you may never
have considered using.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Goals and Themes</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>
Abstract out the embedded features of the Microcosm Address Book, Teleport
List, Notifications and The Palace's Little Buddy with a general solution
that works across many application types.</LI>

<LI>
Aggregate population quickly by providing high-level, immediate value to
end-users, WWW sites, application developers and community builders.</LI>

<LI>
Add features for managing security, people, places and groups.</LI>

<LI>
Broadly leverage our expertise in virtual communities, chat and communication
protocols.</LI>

<LI>
Mine maximum, general value from our identity model.</LI>

<LI>
Add multiple points of presence to the single point of presence of ICQ.</LI>

<LI>
Down the road, this approach allows us to co-opt things like "Net Nanny"
by setting preferences on identities. It allows us to CO-OPT HTTP by adding
pseudonymity to what is an annonymous protocol now. It allows us to co-opt
email by replacing domains with capabilities that sort mail. This also
allows us to add reputation to identity on the 'Net.</LI>

<LI>
Controls who and what I want to know about. It makes requests and hands
out permissions.</LI>
</UL>
<B>2.0 Marketing</B>

<P>Could give WWW site owners the toolkit for free for ninety days so that
they could get a taste of managing a chat or BBS. This way we get our button
on their site for ninety days and they get free chat for ninety days. It
is important to demonstrate the difference between ordered and disorderly
sites.
<OL>
<LI>
We tell WWW owners that chat is coming to their site for free. If they
will put a ComCom button on their WWW site, we will share data with them
and give them moderator functions. Otherwise, we essentially own their
chat site. If the user who pushes this button has ComCom, they are instantly
launched into the text-only ComCom dynachat session (text-only InstantPalace
that downloads with our product. If the user does not have ComCom, they
are sent to our page so they can download it. Once they download, they
connect to the session. If the WWW owner wants more control or richness,
they can pay us to turn on the graphics, get more wizard functions, get
user data about their site from ComCom, control what the protocol releases
to the Spy window, or even control what application is used for chat, etc.</LI>

<LI>
Or, we give chat away for free to these sites in return for them putting
up a ComCom button, which gives them control of the chat site. This makes
for a slower growth curve, as only sites interested would be chatted about.</LI>

<LI>
If Palace, then: when ComCom is loaded, people get Instant Palace for free.
This helps out The Palace by making it nicer because people don't have
to download the applet everytime they join a presentation. Using Palace
technologies helps with development time and provides a smooth growth curve
on Palace functions for WWW pages to turn into Internet Communities. We
sell them up from the text chat to graphics chat to scripting and wizard
and auditorium functions, always giving them means to address their population
via the EC ID (e.g., that WWW site gets a group ID that collects the swiss
IDs of people who have chatted there)</LI>

<LI>
At all points, we are collecting information about where people are and
with whom. We become like Neilson and sell these data.</LI>

<LI>
We aggregate a population of users who are prime customers for our enterprise
and consumer products, making marketing much easier.</LI>

<LI>
We aggregate a population of users who have value to others and get nice
offers like ICQ got from AOL.</LI>

<LI>
We own the WWW WRT to identity and start to add tools that add value to
identity, like client-side certificate managers, etc.</LI>

<LI>
Content can be pushed from the protocol to the ComCom window for advertising.</LI>

<LI>
EC owns a ComCom window for advertising and promotions.</LI>

<LI>
Game company WWW site visitors can start interacting about the game before
they have the software via ComCom.</LI>

Users cannot be in the same place at the same time with the same ID.</LI>

<LI>
Adding new protocol types must be easy and publically published. Offer
a standard scripting language/APIs/preferences that others can use to present
their stuff through ComCom, including: Worlds Away, MPath, Quake, Yahoo
Chat, Lotus Notes, NetMeeting, Microcosm, The Palace, Active Worlds, Worlds

links for the first round of strategic populations with a goal to aggregate
as quickly as possible.</LI>

<LI>
ECID process migration issues must be addressed.</LI>

ComCom must be agnostic regarding the identity system used. ECIDs are only
one type of identity that it can handle. This fosters its usefulness with
existing legacy systems for enterprise usage. Must work with</LI>

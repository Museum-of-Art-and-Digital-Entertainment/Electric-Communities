2/12/97 - Arturo is working on core containership/TOS and ownership ingredients
which he hopes to have done by Monday 2/17. In parallel, Rob is working
on path planning and collision avoidance. Claire, Harry and Mike are coordinating
a large checkin which includes the latest renderer and Claire's new UI ingredients.
After the checking Mike and Trev will move on to transitions. Harry and
John will continue working on articulated avatars, which are already partially
working. <BR>

In the week 2/17/97 - 2/21/97 Rob and Arturo will be getting the new core
una (Region/Prop/Avatar) going with the new composition ingredients. The
aim is to have the world stable again by the end of the week. <A NAME="list"></A><BR>

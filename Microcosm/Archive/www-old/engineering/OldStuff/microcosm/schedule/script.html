<h2>OTHER THINGS TO SHOW:</h2>

Platform independence:
The demonstrations stations should be: Windows 95 & Windows NT. 

<p>
Distributed Architecture:
Demonstrator unplugs the internet connection (modem?) and points out the ramifications 
on the current situation.
Demonstrator unplugs the local net. Look ma, no server!

Implementation compromises:
The Log-in window, Tokens, Teleport Map, and Crowds are all demo versions of those 
objects. The interfaces and security features are not fully implemented for this 
demonstration.

<p>
Notes:
During large-scale tests, all 'Others' are potential Friends and start in the gaming areas 
of the park, waiting for the connect messages from one of the available guide avatars. 

<p>
Once a Friend has been identified for a particular connected guide avatar, that Friend 
should disconnect from the service, and immediately reconnect. (This should generate a 
'User has entered Microcosm' message on the Guide's computer.)

<h1>Word Balloons</h1>



Still need to be able to enter text into word balloons. Basic functionality

(typing, with delete, word balloon grows to fit) is fairly straightforward

and that is what is assumed for the time estimate. Assumption: we route

all key events to the avatar (command keys cause a command to be sent

to the avatar, normal keys cause a character to be added to the avatar's

current word balloon).



<p>



There are other features which are in the spec but would need more

time to do. When should we do them? Here are the features:



<ul>

<li>More text editing capability - select, cut, paste, undo. Cut and paste

    need Java 1.1 to work properly. May be able to get some freeware text

    editor code to help with this.

<li>Embedding of gesture glyphs (e.g. smile, frown). May not be too bad if

    we use a simple mapping of characters to glyphs (using some of the

    spare slots in our 256 entry font).

<li>Embedding of URLs

</ul>

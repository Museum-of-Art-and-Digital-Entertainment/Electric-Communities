<TITLE>The PeekPoke Tutorial</TITLE>

<B><P>Step 4.  Create Ingredient Implementations</P>
</B>
<P>Now that the structures for the entire unum have been created, it is possible to
determine how the ingredients, presences, and una are instantiated at run time. It is
necessary to start with the Ingredient implementations since these provide the code
for all the messages specified in the presences and unum kinds previously coded.</P>

<P>Ingredients are potentially utilized by both host and client presences, however
this is not a requirement.  It is acceptable to have ingredients implemented only on
the host and not the client and vice-versa.</P>

<P>In the code for the ingredient implementation of Peekable, i.e., <FONT
FACE="Courier">iiPeekable</FONT>, the ingredient implementation kind is specified
first. A client must have a reference to its host; <FONT FACE="Courier">myHost</FONT>
serves such purpose. The <FONT FACE="Courier">uPeek</FONT> method deals with messges,
either displaying them if the current presence is a host, or sending them to the host
if the presence is a client. The <FONT FACE="Courier">pHostPeek</FONT> and <FONT
FACE="Courier">pClientPeek</FONT> methods are the actual implementation of their
presences and consist on a call to their corresponding unum, passing along the string
parameter provided by the <FONT FACE="Courier">go</FONT>() method (to be analyzed
later). The order in which these last two methods are called is irrelevant due to optimistic
computation. The ingredient implementation for Pokeable is similar to that for Peekable
thus no description is provided.</P>

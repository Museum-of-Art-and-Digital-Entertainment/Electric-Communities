<P>Peekship unum consists of the elements shown in Figure 2. The unum has two presences, client
presence and host presence, whose structure is similar. At its outermost layer is the Unum
Structure Kind (usk) composed of two Unum Kinds, one for Peekable and one for Pokeable. Although
the unum structure kind is one it si displayed separately for the client and host in the figure
for simplicity purposes.  At the rim of each presence there is a Presence Structure Kind (psk)
each one of them composed of both a peekable and a pokeable. Inside each presence there are two
Ingredient Structure Kinds (isk). For each presence, one isk is for Peekable and the other one
for Pokeable.  These isk are structures that group the kinds involved in the necessary way to
allow the communication necessary between presences and other una to obtain the desired behavior. 
The relationship of the peek and poke icons between the different structure kinds is shown in
later in Figure 3. For explanation purposes only the arrows between usk and isk are displayed.
The semantics of such kind-arrow-kind relation means simply that the kind on both sides of the
arrow are actually the same one.  Just like the usk which is displayed on both sides of the unum.
kinds are represented within the structures they relate to. For example, the unum host has the
same ukPokeable represented inside usk and the host psk.</P>

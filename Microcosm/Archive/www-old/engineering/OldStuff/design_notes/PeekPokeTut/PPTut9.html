<B><P>Step 5. Create Unum Structure</P>
</B>
<P>An unum structure contains the unum’s presences associated to their corresponding
presence kind name.  Since the idea is to have a host/client architecture in which at
least one client is addressed, it is necessary to specify the role of each presence
as well as determine which of them can make other remote presences. The prime
presence is also specified.</P>

	// ---------- Create Unum structure ---------------
	export unum structure usPeekablePokeable {
	  kind uskPeekablePokeable;
	  presence upnHostPeekablePokeable kind pskHostPeekablePokeable 
	      makes upnClientPeekablePokeable;
	  presence upnClientPeekablePokeable kind pskClientPeekablePokeable 
	      makes upnClientPeekablePokeable;
	  prime upnHostPeekablePokeable;
	}

</PRE>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></P>

<P>First of all the kind for the unum structure is specified. Each of the presences
is then assigned a name and the remote presence they can make is provided. In this
case both the host and client presences can make clients.  Last, the presence that is
created first is determined through <FONT FACE="Courier">prime</FONT>. There can be
only one prime presence per unum.</P>

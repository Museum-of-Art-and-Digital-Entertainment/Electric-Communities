<h2>Introduction</h2>

The conversation ingredients manage the networking and group
membership part of speech within a region. They do not manage
telepathy and they do not know any of the details of presentation
(e.g. speech balloons etc.). They take care of taking a Speech object
(which is not much more than a string) and transmitting it to everyone
in a region.
<p>
There are two parts to this code. The Conversation ingredient is part
of the region. The Converser ingredient is part of the avatar. A
Conversation manages a group of Conversers, one for each avatar in
the region.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

As mentioned in the introduction, a Conversation manages a group of
Conversers, one for each avatar in a region. The Conversers and the
Conversation communicate via facets, set up at region entry time.
<p>
The Converser communicates with the Conversation via a revokable
"identi-facet". This is a filler facet; the Converser calls
<code>uSay(speech)</code> on its end of the facet, and the facet then
calls <code>uSay(identity, speech)</code> on the Conversation i.e. it
adds in the identity of the speaker.
<p>
This facet is created by the Conversation when the avatar enters the
region. The Conversation is notified by the containership code when an
avatar enters. The notification contains the identity of the
entering avatar - the containership code will have done an identity
check, to make sure the avatar is who they say they are.  So the
Conversation passes in the checked identity when it creates the facet.
From then on any speech arriving over that facet is stamped with the
identity of the speaker - the speaker can't pretend to be someone
else. In addition the facet is revoked when the avatar leaves the
region (again via a notification from the containership code). This
ensures the avatar can't speak when it's no longer in the region.
<p>
The Conversation communicates with the Converser via a simple
revokeable facet, also set up at region entry. When the avatar
leaves the region it revokes this facet, ensuring that the
Conversation can no longer send it any speech.

<h4>Speech Flow</h4>

The normal flow of a piece of speech (one balloons worth!) is:
<ol>
<li>The Converser receives the speech from the UI input handling
<li>The Converser calls <code>uSay(speech)</code> on its conversation
input facet
<li>The speech travels (possibly across the wire) to the filler part
of the facet, which knows the speaker's identity and calls
<code>uSay(speakersIdentity, speech)</code> on the Conversation
<li>The Conversation calls <code>uSay(speakersIdentity, speech)</code>
on each one of its list of conversation output facets
<li>Each conversation output facet calls into its corresponding
Converser, which calls on the UI code to display the speech
</ol>
Note that the speech is not reflected locally; even the speaker doesn't
see it until after the round trip to the Conversation. This can
introduce noticeable delay, and make the application seem unresponsive,
but it preserves conversation ordering.

<h4>Some Complications</h4>

Overall the design of Conversation and Converser is pretty simple.
There are a few messy side issues though:
<ul>
<li>When an avatar enters a region it's actually the avatar body
that goes through the containership negotiation (the avatar itself
is not containable). So the conversation facet exchange has to
go via the avatar body and the avatar body link. This complicates
things, and would raise new security issues if we had remotely
hosted bodies. At the moment we don't; and even if we did they'd
probably be hosted by the region, which we're trusting anyway.
<li>The conversation ingredients are currently used to transmit
name changes i.e. if someone in the region changes their name
this notification travels via the conversation to others in the
region. This should probably be done by entirely separate facets.
<li>If a Converser can't reach a Conversation, or vice versa, then
the avatar has almost certainly lost contact with the region. The
current code assumes this is the case and goes into a pending mode
where it buffers up any incoming speech to use in the next region.
It's not clear that this is the right thing to do.
</ul>

<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>This conversation implementation is only as secure as the
region. Given a well behaved region, no-one can pretend to be someone
they aren't. But if the region wants to generate speech and pretend it
comes from someone else, it can do it.
<li>All the code runs in the E run thread, it is not thread safe.
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

The conversation ingredients are Pluribus code, so they're not
JavaDoc'd.  What follows are the main interfaces ("kinds" in Pluribus)
used between the Converser and Conversation ingredients.

<h4>kind Conversation Output</h4>

A conversation keeps a list of conversation outputs, one for each
participant in the conversation. Whenever someone says something, or
changes their name, the conversation fans out the appropriate message
to all its outputs. Each output implements the following interface:

<pre>
    /**
     * The given identity has said the given speech
     * @param identity    the identity who spoke
     * @param speech      what they said
     */
    uSay(SturdyIdentity identity, Speech speech);

    /**
     * The given identity has changed their name
     * @param identity    the identity which changed names; identity.getName()
     *   can be used to the new name
     * @param oldName     their name before the name change
     */
    uNameChange(SturdyIdentity identity, String oldName);
</pre>

<h4>kind ukConversationInput</h4>

A conversation also keeps a list of conversation input facets, one for
each participant in the conversation. Conversation inputs are "filler
facets"; they store the identity associated with them and each call to
the facet is translated into a similar call on the conversation, with
the identity as argument. e.g. the person holding the facet calls
'uSay(speech)'; the facet then calls 'iSay(identity, speech)' on the
conversation object. So, once the facet is set up, all communication
through the input to the conversation is stamped with the
participant's identity.

<pre>
    /**
     * uSetOutput is used during setup to let the conversation know where
     * to send output for the participant corresponding to this input.
     * @param output      the output facet for the participant
     */
    uSetOutput(kind ukConversationOutput output);

    /**
     * Say something; this speech will be stamped with the identity
     * associated with this participant and will then be distributed
     * to everyone in the conversation.
     * @param speech      what was said
     */
    uSay(Speech speech);

    /**
     * The given participant has changed it's name (i.e. it's "handle";
     * it can't change it's nickname because that is decided by others).
     * This name change will be stamped with the identity associated
     * with this participant and will then be distributed to everyone
     * in the conversation.
     * @param newName     the new name (the input facet knows the old name
     *   because it is part of the identity object held by the facet)  
     */
    uNameChange(String newName);
</pre>

<h4>Facet Setup</h4>

A facet implementing <code>kind ukConversationInput</code> is created
by the Conversation and then given (via the body) to the avatar, when
the avatar enters a region. The avatar then creates a facet of
<code>kind ukConversationOutput</code> and links it up by calling
<code>uSetOutput</code> on the input facet.
<p>
At this point the newly entered avatar has an input facet (for
sending speech to everyone else) and an output facet (for
receiving speech). Any speech sent via the input facet is
"stamped" with the avatar's identity and then fanned out to
everyone in the region, including the sending avatar.
<p>
On region exit the Conversation is notified that the avatar has
left. It removes both the input and output facet from its tables,
and revokes the input facet. The Converser (in the avatar) knows
the avatar has left so discards its useless input facet and revokes
and discards its output facet, replacing them with new facets for
the new region it is entering.

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use trace category "conversation" to track the conversation code.
</ul>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>This conversation design might change radically if we changed
to a more session based architecture like Scott's DObjects. In that
case it might make more sense for the host "presence" of the avatar
to send conversation messages to each of its remote presences, rather
than using an explicit central planning point. This might lead to
some ordering problems though; at the moment everyone is guaranteed
to see conversation in the same order, because it all goes through
a central fanning point.
<li>More work is needed at region entry and exit time. Users need
to have a common view on what is "heard" by others, even if one
of them is just leaving or just entering the region.
<li>In the current design, the region can spoof conversation. Making
conversation truly secure (so the region couldn't spoof it) would
involve either encrypting every piece of speech with the speakers
private key (currently too expensive) or setting up a series of short
lived, but cheaper, keys.

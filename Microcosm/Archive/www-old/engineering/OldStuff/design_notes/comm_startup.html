<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Basic Message Formats</FONT></B></P>

<P>The Connection Startup Protocol uses messages formatted with java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.
The first byte of the message is one of the types defined in ec.e.net.Msg.
PROTOCOL_VERSION, PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED, and STARTUP are used in the startup
protocol.</P>

<P>The PROTOCOL_VERSION message: (byte type=PROTOCOL_VERSION=16, int obsolete,
String 1stProtocolID, String 2ndProtocolID, ...). Where obsolete is set
to 4 to ensure incompatibility with version 2 of the E protocol.</P>

<P>The PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED message: (byte type=PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED=22, int
0, String protocolID).</P>

<P>The STARTUP message is used for all the rest of the messages: (byte
type=STARTUP=17, int token, String arg1, String arg2, String arg3). Where
arg1, arg2, and arg3 are defined in the protocol description below, and
token is defined in ec.e.net.MsgConnection and is one of:</P>

<P>There are three layers of code responsible for connections in the comm
system. The top level is ConnectionsManager. It is responsible for all
the connections between a Habi* vat and other vats. It includes methods
such as &quot;EConnection connection(remoteRegistrarID, searchPath)&quot;
which either creates a connection and returns it, or returns an existing
connection.</P>

<P>The connection to a specific other vat is handled by the EConnection.
It is responsible for building new connections and resuming suspended connections.</P>

<P>The connection to a specific machine is handled by the MsgConnection.
It, along with its steward and crew manage one TCP connection.</P>

<P>The normal connection build process starts with the connection call
to the ConnectionsManager described above. The remoteRegisterID parameter
specifies which specific vat is wanted, and the searchPath parameter specifies
places to look for it. The search path is normally a set of Process Location
Servers to query.</P>

<P>The search for a vat starts by building a MsgConnection to a PLS. If
that PLS knows where the vat is, it returns the IP address and port number
which is inserted into the search path. The currently active instance of
MsgConnection has then completed it's job, so it closes the TCP connection,
and notifies the EConnection that it has shutdown. The EConnection then
builds a new MsgConnection to try the next address in the search path.</P>

<P>The connection startup protocol (Alice is connecting to Bob) used by
the MsgConnection is as follows. Note that there are two interleaved protocol
negotiations involved. The version of the E protocol to use, and the low
level encryption/compression protocol. The E protocol negotiation is over
quickly, while the encryption protocol negotiation involves the exchange
of keys and the verification of identities.</P>

<P>In the description below, &lt;PROBLEM&gt; is one of ERR_PROTOCOL, if
a wrong protocol message type was received or the remote end is using an
unsupported version of the protocol, or ERR_WRONG_ID if the far end responds
IAM for the wrong registrarID or the remote public key does not hash to
the registrarID. TOK_ERR_INTERNAL is used to notify the other end that
an internal error has caused the connection attempt to fail.</P>

<P>The protocol is described using the notation, &quot;Sender: message
paremeters (comments)&quot;</P>

<PRE>-------------------Outgoing Startup State------------------------ 
 Alice: PROTOCOL_VERSION &lt;list of E protocol versions supported&gt;.

 Alice: IWANT &lt;bobRegistrarID&gt;


-----------------Incoming New Connection State-------------------
   Bob: PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED version of E protocol to use,
    or  &lt;PROBLEM&gt; and throw exception.

------------------Incoming Expect IWANT State--------------------
   Bob: IAM &lt;bobRegisterID&gt;&lt;bobPublicKey&gt;  (continue with protocol)
    or  IAM &lt;bobRegisterID&gt;           (continue, no authentication)
    or  NOTME                         (try next site in search path)
    or  TRY &lt;possibleAlternatePath&gt;   (add to search path, try next site)
    or  DUP                           (crossed connections, quietly stop)
    or  &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)
</PRE>

<PRE>-------------------Outgoing Expect IAM State---------------------</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives TRY, as she would from the PLS, she adds the &lt;possibleAlternatePath&gt;
to her search path and shuts down the MsgConnection. If she receives NOTME
(NotMe) she just shuts down the MsgConnection without adding to the path.
The EConnection will build a new MsgConnection to try the next entry in
the path (if any).</P>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's IAM:</P>

<PRE> Alice: GIVEINFO &lt;aliceRegistrarID&gt; &lt;alicesPathToAlice&gt; &lt;alicePublicKey&gt;
    or  GIVEINFO &lt;aliceRegistrarID&gt; &lt;alicesPathToAlice&gt;    (no authentication)
    or  &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)
</PRE>

<PRE>-----------------Incoming Expect GIVEINFO State------------------</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives Alice's GIVEINFO and Bob only knows of one connection:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: REPLYINFO &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;&lt;cryptoProtocols&gt;   (continue)
    or  REPLYINFO &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;                    (continue, no crypto)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives Alice's GIVEINFO and Bob knows of crossed connections
and Bob is the catbird:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: REPLYINFO &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;&lt;cryptoProtocols&gt;   (continue)
    or  REPLYINFO &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;                    (continue, no crypto)
    or  DUP                                          (stop, crossed connections)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives Alice's GIVEINFO and Bob knows of crossed connections
and Alice is the catbird:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: REPLYINFO &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;&lt;cryptoProtocols&gt;   (continue)
    or  REPLYINFO &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;                    (continue, no crypto)
    or  YOUCHOSE  &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;&lt;cryptoProtocols&gt;   (continue)
    or  YOUCHOSE  &lt;bobsPathToBob&gt;                    (continue, no crypto)</PRE>

<P>Where &lt;cryptoProtocols&gt; is a comma separated list of crypto protocol
versions that Bob knows (see &lt;version&gt; below), in order from most
favored to least favored.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Crossed connection notes<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>A crossed connection exists when Alice tries to build a connection
to Bob at the same time Bob is trying to build a connection to Alice. 
If Bob's RegistrarID is greater than Alice's, then Bob is the catbird and
must decide which of the two connections to use.  Otherwise Alice is the
catbird and she must be notified that she is to decide.</P>

<P>Since the GIVEINFO state is on an incoming connection, Bob is in a position
to notice that he is also in the process of building a connection to Alice,
and the potential for crossed connections exists.  If he is not the catbird
he notifies Alice that she must decide by sending the YOUCHOSE message.<BR>
<BR>
If he is the catbird, he looks at the state of the outgoing connection.
 He decides to keep the incoming or the outgoing connection based on that
state:</P>

<PRE>    ST_UNSTARTED                      Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_IAM            Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_REPLYINFO      Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_GOTOO          Keep outgoing
    ST_EXPECT_MESSAGE                 Keep outgoing</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives the YOUCHOSE message on her outgoing connection attempt,
she looks at the state of any incoming connection for Bob's registrarID
she my know about.  She decides to keep the incoming or the outgoing connection
based on that state:</P>

<PRE>    No connection known               Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_IWANT          Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_GIVEINFO       Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_GO             Keep incoming
    ST_EXPECT_MESSAGE                 Keep incoming</PRE>

<P>When Bob eliminates the outgoing connection or Alice eliminates the
incoming connection, they &quot;disown&quot; the connection they are terminating.
This action causes it to close the TCP connection and terminate the MsgConnection.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<PRE>----------------Outgoing Expect REPLYINFO State------------------
</PRE>

<P>If Alice received an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE> Alice: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives a DUP she stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.
 If she receives one of the &lt;PROBLEM&gt; responses, she generates an
error log and stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.</P>

<P>If Alice receives a YOUCHOSE, she choses which connection to eliminate.</P>

<PRE> Alice: QUIT                          (If she keeps the incoming)</PRE>

<P>Otherwise she processes the YOUCHOSE the same as a REPLYINFO.</P>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's REPLYINFO and there is an outgoing suspendID:</P>

<PRE> Alice: RESUME &lt;suspendID&gt;            (resume suspended connection)</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's REPLYINFO and it includes a crypto protocol
Alice supports:</P>

<PRE> Alice: GO &lt;crypto parameters&gt;        (continue)</PRE>

<P>Otherwise when Alice receives Bob's REPLYINFO:</P>

<PRE> Alice: GO                            (continue, no crypto)


--------------------Incoming Expect GO State---------------------
</PRE>

<P>If Bob received an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a RESUME from Alice and the suspendID matches his suspendID:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: GOTOO                         (resume connection)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a RESUME and the suspendIDs do not match:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: BYE                           (Wrong suspendID)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a QUIT he stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.</P>

<P>If Bob receives a GO and detects a crossed connection and decides that
this MsgConnection should be abandoned:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: BYE                           (crossed connections)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a GO and expects a RESUME:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: BYE                           (discarded resumable connection)</PRE>

<P>If Bob receives a GO and it includes a supported crypto &lt;version&gt;:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: GOTOO &lt;crypto parameters&gt;     (Bob starts encrypted session)</PRE>

<P>Otherwise if the GO does not include a supported crypto &lt;version&gt;:</P>

<PRE>   Bob: GOTOO                         (Bob starts unencrypted session)


-------------------Outgoing Expect GOTOO State-------------------</PRE>

<P>If Alice received an invalid message type:</P>

<PRE> Alice: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</PRE>

<P>If Alice receives a BYE, she stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.</P>

<P>If Alice receives Bob's GOTOO, she starts an encrypted session or unencrypted
session depending on whether Bob has sent &lt;crypto parameters&gt;. Thence
both can send each other E messages according to the message protocol.<BR>

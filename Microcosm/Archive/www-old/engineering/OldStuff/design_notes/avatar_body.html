<h2>Introduction</h2>

In Microcosm the avatar and the avatar body are separate una. This document
explains why, and outlines what each unum does and how they are linked.
<p>
The original motivation for splitting avatar and avatar body was to allow
a region to provide a body for an avatar on entry. This body might have
different properties to the usual body - it might have more limited
features or extra powers appropriate to the region. For example "observers",
avatars present in a region but not allowed to participate, might share
a common "observer body" provided by the region. Or a sword fighting
region might provide you with a body whose head could be lopped off.
<p>
In practice this has not been implemented. Instead the avatar body split
has been used for an entirely different purpose - body swapping. In the
current Microcosm avatar bodies are always co-hosted with the avatar.
But the avatar may change bodies, and hence change its appearance. This
is how the avatar catalog works - it does a body swap.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

The first three sections describe the avatar unum, the avatar body
unum and the link between them. The rest describe some of the problems
that arise because of the split between avatar and body.

<h5>The Avatar Unum</h5>

The avatar unum is a very special unum. It contains all the state that
belongs to a particular avatar identity - the identity object itself,
the address book, the inventory, the catalogs, links to the avatar's
locally hosted realm (containing the private room(s) and the turf).
<p>
It can be helpful to think of the avatar as the users session - in a
sense an instance of the Microcosm application has the purpose of
allowing an avatar to enter the distributed world, and to allow the
avatar to see and interact with that world. At the moment, all other
una are ultimately owned by some avatar, but noone owns an avatar.
<p>
Because the avatar is so special it has a lot of capabilities which
are not available to most una. It is initialized with access to the
UI, file system and registrar.
<p>
The avatar is also special because it doesn't create any client
presences of itself. It sends out its body as its representative,
and the body creates client presences.

<h5>The Avatar Body</h5>

The avatar body is a more conventional unum. It has the standard
containership and composition ingredients, and few special capabilities.
You can think of it as being a specialized prop, which has a unique
relationship with the avatar - the "avatar body link".
<p>
In the current Microcosm the avatar body is always created by the avatar
(from the avatar catalog), and is therefore co-hosted with the avatar.
Each body has only one owner (avatar) and each avatar uses only one body
at a time.
<p>
The avatar body is not just a containable, it is also a slotted
container. It has a slot for the hand and other slots for masks and
accessories.

<h5>The Avatar Body Link</h5>

The avatar body link makes use of three facets. The first, on the
avatar body, is used to set up the relationship between the avatar and
the body - its the body's "set owner" facet.
<p>
If this facet is successfully used to link the avatar and the body
then two further facets are set up. One, the "body facet for avatar"
is used by the avatar to do things to the body e.g move it into a new
region, or notify it of a name change. The other, the "avatar facet
for body" is used by the body to communicate with the avatar e.g. to
notify it if the body's "in hand" slot contains something.
<p>
Both these facets are set up when the avatar takes ownership of the
body, and are revoked if the avatar switches to another body.  The
avatar and the body both have an ingredient devoted to setting up,
maintaining and revoking these facets - the AvatarLinkToBody
ingredient in the avatar, and the BodyLinkToAvatar in the body.

<h5>Region Entry and Identity Checking</h5>

Entering a region is mainly a containership operation. That's certainly
how the design started out, and though the current implementation has
some session ideas built in the basic region entry operation still looks
like a containership call.
<p>
This means that the "enter region" call has to be made using the
avatar body, not the avatar, because only the avatar body is a
containable. This introduces a problem because the region wants to
have control over which avatars can enter (based on avatar
identity). But the body is a different object from the avatar; so
how does the region know who the body represents?
<p>
The current mechanism to do this is rather complex (probably too
complex). The body knows the identity of the avatar who owns it.  It
also has a facet to talk to the avatar (the "avatar facet for body"
mentioned earlier).
<p>
On region entry the body gives the region an "unum bundle" containing,
among other things, the identity of the avatar. It also gives the
region a "set new parent facet" - a containership facet used by the
entry protocol. Before entry the body uses its facet on the avatar to
register the "set new parent facet" as one of the capabilities known
to the avatar's identity (note that only the current body can register
a facet in this way).
<p>
When the region sees the identity in the unum bundle it calls back
into the identity to check if the provided "set new parent facet" is
known to the identity. If it is, and the identity is acceptable, then
it allows entry, otherwise it refuses. This check prevents avatar A
from presenting a body marked with avatar B's identity. The region
would detect because when it asked B if the provided "set new parent
facet" was known to B, B would say no. This process does assume
a trustworthy body (more on this later).
<p>
For more on how the avatar and body change regions, see the
<li><A href="avatar_change_region.html">avatar change region ingredient</a>
document.

<h5>Of Hands, Heads and Accessories</h5>

The avatar body is a slotted container, with slots for the hand, head
(mask) and accessories. So the body contains the "in hand" object and
any mask and accessories. There are a couple of problems with this.
<p>
The first is that the only real link the avatar has to the "in hand"
object etc. is provided by the body. Given the current co-hosted and
trusted body this is ok. But what if the body where hosted elsewhere,
and refused to give up its contents?
<p>
The second is that the "in hand" object affects the UI.  For example,
if the avatar has something in its hand and you click on the floor you
get a "put down" menu entry. This is handled by the verb and behavior
mechanism and, in particular, by the AvatarUIContext ingredient, in
the avatar unum. This ingredient needs to know something about the in
hand object in order to coordinate the menus. So the body communicates
any changes in the "in hand" state to the avatar, using the "avatar
facet for body". This notification is asynchronous, so you have to be
careful about races.

<h5>Should You Trust Your Body?</h5>

I can imagine three levels of trust for the body:
<ol>
<li>Body created and co-hosted by avatar. Completely trusted
<li>Body created and co-hosted by region. Trusted as much as the region
<li>Body created by someone else. Untrusted (well, maybe trusted as much
as the object that created it).
</ol>
I'm sure category three has many sub categories. But category one and
two are, I suspect, the most interesting.
<p>
In the current Microcosm we only have category one. This makes things
nice and simple, and also means you don't have to worry about network
errors over the avatar body link, which simplifies things considerably.
<p>
Some interesting questions come up, should we ever look at category
two again. It would require a fair bit of work - new region entry
protocol and more error handling. But it also seems to introduce some
trust issues. What if a malicious region refuses to give you back your
"in hand" object and accessories when you leave? If the region hosts
the body then it has the ultimate say on what contains them, not you.
If you owned the objects you could retrieve them via the inventory
but it would still be surprising if your accessories disappeared
when you changed region.
<p>
Confusing the issue further, the region already is the ultimate
authority on what you see while you're in the region - it introduces
you to all other objects it contains. So a malicious region can always
interpose a "man in the middle" between you and its contents. So if
you pick something up in a region the region could always yank it back
at any time. I wonder if there is any guarantee we can make to users
that would make sense to them - would they buy "the region can't take
things out of your hand unless you picked it up in that region or it
hosts your body"? To me, this sounds too complicated to be reassuring.

<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>The current code assumes a trustworthy, co-hosted avatar body
<li>The current code is all within the vat so it does not do any
synchronization or locking.
</ul>


<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

Unfortunately the avatar and avatar body are all Pluribus code so
I can't use JavaDoc here. But I can include the kind files for
the facets connecting avatar and body, and the kind files for
the ingredients in the avatar and the body which maintain the link.
<p>
Here's the kind file for the facets; you can find the full code in
<code>src/cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar/AvatarBodyLink_kind.plu</code>:

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<ul>
<li>Turn on trace category "bodylink" to get tracing messages about the
avatar to body link.
</ul>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced the avatar body split was a good idea. I'm
certainly not happy with the way it turned out, it seems way too complex
and messy. Most of this is, obviously, my fault. But I think at least
part of it is due to not having a clear model of sessions and region
entry (most of the code was written long before we introduced the
idea of sessions). I would strongly recommend revisiting the whole
idea of an avatar body split when sessions and containment are
redesigned. Even if having a separate avatar and body is the right
thing to do I suspect the current code will need to be rewritten
(and maybe better names would help: maybe user session and avatar,
rather than avatar and avatar body; the current names have caused
no end of confusion).
<li>The avatar body's "in hand" code should be checked. This was
originally written before slotted containership existed, and it
had some (at the time) unavoidable races that slotted containership
was going to fix. I've never had time to go back and check that
the races were properly fixed.
<li>The avatar body is supposed to be "identity stamped", so that if
the region is trustworthy it should be impossible for an avatar to
present a body with an identity other than its own. That means if you
see the label on an avatar body (e.g. Fred {My Friend Fred}) you
should be able to trust it. For this to work the region presence
(actually the composition ingredient in the region presence) is
supposed to "stamp" the avatar body presenter with the avatar's
identity, before giving it to the avatar body (the region can be sure
of the identity because it did an identity check before letting the
body in, as described earlier in this document). This isn't
implemented yet; currently the avatar body itself does the stamping,
which means it can make up any identity it wants.
</ul>

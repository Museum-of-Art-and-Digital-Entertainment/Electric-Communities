<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Introduction</FONT></P>

<P>This is documentation for the shooting interaction and all associated
ingredients and unums, as implemented for the PC Forum demo.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Overview</FONT></P>

<P>Shooting is an interaction between several parties, each of which may
be on different machines, each of which may have credentials to deliver
to each other in order to securely complete the interaction, and each of
which may have special behavior with respect to shooting. For this reason
the shooting protocol essentially moves through each party in turn, gathering
credentials and performing checks.</P>

<P>HACK: The necessary UI hooks for message delivery were just added to

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Init</FONT></P>

<P>&quot;Shooter&quot; Avatars are created and initialized as normal with
no extra paramaters.</P>

<P>Gun props are created and initiliazed as normal Props with no extra
paramaters, and are acquired by Shooter Avatars by simply picking up the
Gun like any other Prop.</P>

<P>A ShootingJudge is initiliazed like a normal Prop but with extra paramaters,
and creates a series of Targets when it is created. The extra parameters
given to the ShootingJudge (currently through RealmText) can cause them
to instantiate different kinds and numbers of targets at different positions.
Targets also acquire a reference to their ShootingJudge in init.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Shooting Protocol</FONT></P>

<P><B>UI sends uShoot() to Target's UI Ingredient</B></P>

<P>The first message of the protocol goes to the Target; this was just
the simplest UI mechanism when the protocol was written. Target is not
really the appropriate reciever of the initial message of the protocol,
since at this point the Target has no arguments on which to perform verification.
The only check that could be performed at this point is that the Target's
internal state indicates that it is allowed to be shot by <I>anything at
all</I> at this point.</P>

<P>The uShoot() message is sent on the basis of the user clicking on the
Target (ie, &quot;Shoot&quot; is the default item in the pie menu for Targets).
No checking of user-click coordinates vs server-side Target coordinates
is involved so no client-server latency is visible.</P>

<P><B>Target sends uShootAtMe(Target) to Shooter</B></P>

<P>This is an opportunity for the Shooter (an Avatar, typically) to verify
the fact that he can and wants to shoot. The Shooter needs to produce his
capability to shoot, ie a gun and bullets, from his hand (represented by
containership behavior within the Shooter Avatar Unum). HACK: currently
the Avatar just uses a global variable to get to the Gun in his hand.</P>

<P><B>Shooter sends uShoot(Shooter, Gun) to Target</B></P>

<P>Here's where the Target would do any real checking that it is delegated
to do. It currently does nothing but pass the message on to it's ShootingJudge.</P>

<P><B>Target sends uShot(Shooter, Gun, Target) to ShootingJudge</B></P>

<P>The ShootingJudge would perform the task of verifying that the gun is
a valid gun, verifying that there are valid bullets available, and spending
the actual scarce bullet as managed by a central authority for bullets.
HACK: not currently implemented. ShootingJudge allows any shot to complete,
as long as the arguments to uShot are of the correct kinds.</P>

<P>The ShootingJudge also exists to keep and store any information about
the group of Targets it manages, such as score. </P>

<P><B>ShootingJudge sends uTakeShot() to Target</B></P>

<P>This message informs the target that it has indeed been shot (all parties
are in agreement and all credentials have been verified). At the moment
this triggers a gesture for being shot and then teleports the target back
to the position at which it was created, which was the correct behavior
for 3D Motion Factory gargoyles.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Problems</FONT></P>

<OL>
<LI>Scarcity for bullets is not implemented, as stated. Bullets need to
be managed like a currency, ie, bullets can be double-spent. This means
that the party responsible for expending the bullets (the ShootingJudge)
needs a reference to the party that enforces scarcity for bullets, which
can come as a special capability to the Gun or to some Unum representing
a store of bullets. However, once the owner of the bullets has granted
the capability for a bullet to be spent, the ShootingJudge must have some
way of verifying the identity of the party responsible for scarcity of
bullets. This is a fairly large problem area, involving minting of Microcosm
authority certificates. This will be hacked around for the next revision
of shooting.</LI>

<LI>There seems to be significant latency the first time the protocol is
executed, but not thereafter.</LI>

<LI>Gargoyles don't actually perform a gesture for being shot, although
they receive the command to do so. This is a matter of support for gestures
at the Motion Factory level.</LI>

<LI>The initial message should be to the Avatar, with the Target as an
argument.</LI>

<LI>The Shooter Avatar needs to get access to the Gun the correct way,
ie through privileged <I>intra</I>-unum messaging with the container ingredient
representing the Avatar's hand.</LI>

<LI>There are issues with what party would be able to initiate and bring
to completion the shooting protocol. For instance, having acquired a reference
to the Gun, Target and Shooter Avatar, some other party able to fire off
an unum message might be able to initiate the protocol and cause a shot
to be fired. This is an issue with the idea of the &quot;user session&quot;
and what security properties it should have, or alternately an issue with
the region as a context for unum messaging and what security properties
it should have.</LI>

<H1>The Demo Realm Ingredients</H1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This design note explains the demo realm ingredients hacked into Microcosm
to make the PCForum demo work. These ingredients should be removed as soon
as possible, but they need to be replaced by something that provides their
functionality (and more!) in a more sanitary manner.

<h1>Overview</h1>

There are two sets of ingredients that implement the demo realm handling.
The first, the DemoRealmDirectory ingredients, implement a directory which
keeps track of all avatars, teleport pads and regions in a realm. These
ingredients (client and server) are used to implement a DemoRealmDirectory
unum. For PCForum a DemoRealmDirectory did represent a realm, so this
document uses "realm" and "DemoRealmDirectory" interchangeably.

<p>

The second set are the DemoRealmTracker ingredients. Again, these are
client/server ingredients. They are incorporated into an avatar unum.

<p>

Whenever an avatar enters a new region via an entry pad, the entry pad
lets the avatar know which realm it is entering. If the avatar was
previously in a different realm it lets the old realm (i.e.
DemoRealmDirectory unum) know it is leaving, then informs the new
realm it has arrived. The old realm lets all avatars still in the old
realm know that the avatar has left. The new realm lets all avatars in
the new realm know that the avatar has arrived. The newly arrived
avatar also asks the realm for the names of all avatars in the realm,
and for the names and references to all the teleport pads in the
realm.

<h1>The DemoRealmDirectory Ingredients And Unum</h1>

The DemoRealmDirectory ingredients are simple client server ingredients.
The clients are dumb - they forward all requests to the server. These
ingredients are the only ones used when building a DemoRealmDirectory
unum, which was the placeholder realm for PCForum. 

<p>

The server DemoRealmDirectory ingredient maintains the following tables:

<ul>
<li>A table of avatar names and avatar references
<li>A table of teleport pad names and teleport pad references
<li>A table of region names and region references
</ul>

The avatar table has <code>PersonName</code> objects as keys and avatar
references as values. A <code>PersonName</code> contains a short, user
visible, name (e.g. Dax) and a long, globally unique name - the EARL
of the avatar's telepathy manager. The table contains <code>PersonName</code>
objects for every avatar that has ever been in the realm. If the avatar
is currently in the realm, the corresponding value in the table is a
reference to the avatar unum. If the avatar isn't in the realm the
corresponding value is null.

<p>

The avatar table is used in two ways. Firstly it is used to notify
avatars in the realm when someone enters or leaves. Because it has
references to all avatars currently in the realm it can iterate
through them and call a method on them (actually on their
DemoRealmTracker ingredient) letting them know someone has arrived or
left. Secondly the keys in the table are used by avatars to update
their <code>PersonName</code> tables. The avatars need some way to map
short names to global names so they can do telepathy. So whenever an
avatar enters a realm it asks the realm for all the
<code>PersonName</code> objects it knows about. The avatar then adds
these to its own table, so it expands its knowledge about which short
name maps to which global name.

<p>

The teleport pad table is a convenience for avatars who enter the
realm. When the realm is constructed all teleport pads are registered
with the realm (this is easy to do because I make the assumption that
there is one and only one realm per agency; this is a bogus assumption
but it was true for PCForum). When an avatar enters the realm it asks
the realm for all its teleport pads. The avatar then adds these pads
to its own teleport list.

<p>

The region table is used to support our current client connection
protocol. Again, this approach relies on some bogus assumptions
that were good enough for PCForum. As every region is created it
registers itself with the realm. The realm is then registered with
the name service under a predictable name. When a client connects
it specifies a realm name and a region name. It gets a reference to
the realm by looking it up in the name service. The client then
asks the realm for the region, by name. The realm looks the name
up in its region table, and returns it.

<p>

One final hack. The realm is stored in a global variable. Because
of the assumption of one realm per agency, the server presences of
all una created in a realm can get to their realm via this
global. This is how an entry pad knows its realm. When an avatar
uses an entry pad, the entry pad sends a message to its server
presence, with the avatar as the argument. The server presence
then calls:

<p><code>
  avatar <- (kind ukDemoRealmTracker).uCheckRealm(Global.theRealm);
</code><p>

This allows the avatar to tell if it has changed realms; if so it
can notify its old and new realms, update its tables and teleport
pad list from the new realm, etc.


<h1>The DemoRealmTracker Ingredients</h1>

The DemoRealmTracker ingredients are added to the avatar, and are used
to communicate with the DemoRealmDirectory whenever there is a realm
change. The ingredients are simple client/server - dumb clients that
forward everything to the server.

<p>

The server ingredient has the following state:
<ul>
<li>The current realm for this avatar
<li>The <code>PersonName</code> of this avatar
<li>The session directory for this avatar (maps short names to global names)
</ul>

The ingredient provides the following operations:

<p><code>
  uCheckRealm(kind ukDemoRealmDirectory realm);<br>
  uAvatarEnteredRealm(PersonName name);<br>
  uAvatarExitedRealm(PersonName name);<br>
</code><p>

The first method, <code>uCheckRealm</code>, is called by entry pads whenever
an avatar enters a new region. It checks if the given realm is the same as
the avatar's current realm. If so it does nothing. If not it:
<ul>
<li>Lets the old realm know the avatar is leaving
<li>Lets the new realm know the avatar is arriving
<li>Adds all the <code>PersonName</code> objects known by the new realm to
this avatar's session directory
<li>Adds all the teleport pads known by the new realm to this avatar's
teleport list
</ul>

Note that the session directory is a java object, which is shared with
the TelepathyManager (they both get references to it when the unum is
initialized). The teleport list is a neighbor ingredient.

<p>

<code>uAvatarEnteredRealm</code> is called by the realm when a new
avatar enters the realm. As we've seen the realm keeps a table of all
avatars it currently contains. When a new avatar enters it notifies
the realm, as we just saw in <code>uCheckRealm</code>. The realm then
notifies all the other avatars via the
<code>uAvatarEnteredRealm</code> method.

<p>

A similar process happens when an avatar leaves a realm, via the
<code>uAvatarExitedRealm</code> method. Note that this notification
should probably be done per world, not per realm.

<h1>Problems</h1>

Well there's really not much right with these ingredients right now.
They make the bogus 1 realm per agency assumption, they don't consider
security at all and they mix up realm and world functionality. They
got us through PCForum, and they give some hints about what the real
Realm and World una will have to do. But I doubt if they provide any
basis for future implementation work.

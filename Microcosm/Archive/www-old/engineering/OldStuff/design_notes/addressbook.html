<h2>Introduction</h2>

The address book is a feature in Microcosm which allows the "local
avatar" (i.e. the users avatar) to keep track of other
avatars. Avatars who are in the address book are "acquaintances";
avatars who aren't are "strangers". The address book has many
features:
<ul>
<li>You can share information about your avatar with others (and
to change your avatar's name)
<li>You can see information about other avatars
<li>You can check if another avatar is currently on line
<li>You can communicate with another avatar (start a telepathy
balloon, use VoxChat, visit their turf or send them email)
<li>You can choose nick names for other avatars
<li>You can set the privileges which you allow other avatars
to have (the right to send you telepathy, the right to visit
your turf). These can be set per avatar, for all acquaintances
or all strangers.
<li>You can specify a list of avatars to track, so you'll know
when they are on line.
</ul>
Overall, though the address book has a lot of features, each feature
is simple; so the ingredient is complex, but not deep. It also makes
heavy use of the <A href="identity.html">identity</a> and
<A href="identity_name.html">identity naming</a> packages to do
some of the hard work.
<p>
This document only deals with the internals of the address book; the
UI code is a large, and fairly cleanly separated, class in its own
right.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

The address book ingredient is one of the avatar ingredients. It has a
"neighbor" interface which is used by other avatar ingredients to:
<ul>
<li>map names to avatar identities (and vice versa)
<li>to check permissions for identities, and track changes in those permissions
<li>to track changes in the local avatar's description e.g. name changes
</ul>
Its other big interface is to the address book UI; this is described
more below.

<h5>Address Book State</h5>

There are several important pieces of avatar state. These are all
declared in the state bundle for the address book, so they persist.

<dl>

<dt>The local avatar page
<dd>This contains information about the local avatar (name,
basic information fields, hobbies, essay) and also the default
privileges given to "stranger" avatars (i.e. avatars which don't
have a page in the address book).

<dt>Avatar page tables
<dd>A pair of hashtables are used to map (nick) names and identities
to AvatarPage objects. AvatarPage objects contain details about
another avatar (name, basic information fields, hobbies, essay)
and also contain the privileges given to that avatar (telepathy,
right to visit turf).

<dt>Identity name table
<dd>This is used to keep track of avatar nick names - see <A
href="identity_name.html">identity naming</a> for more details.
Note that the AvatarPage objects, in the avatar page tables, all
contain an IdentityNameRef for their avatar, which ensures that
the nick names of all avatars in the address book are maintained
in the IdentityNameTable.

<dt>Avatar name list
<dd>A sorted list of avatar names. This is handy for some functions
needed by the UI but I'm not sure it should be maintained all the time
(as it is now); it might be better to just generate a copy as needed,
to avoid the problems of keeping it up to date.

</dl>

<h5>Ingredient to UI Communication</h5>

The address book is fairly cleanly split from its UI. Its UI is on the
other side of the presenter layer, operating in a different thread, so
there are two presenter level interfaces for the UI and the ingredient
to communicate. The ingredient uses the AddressBookPresenter interface
to update the UI. The UI calls back into the ingredient via the
AddressBookInputHandler interface. 
<p>
The UI is assumed to be the only way some changes can happen to the
address book e.g. a callback from the UI is the only way to change the
local avatar's name. Because of this the address book UI doesn't
register to watch for address book changes (more of this below); it
is more tightly linked to the ingredient than a normal registered
watcher (maybe it shouldn't be?).
<p>
Having the UI and ingredient in different threads introduces the risk
of synchronization problems. To avoid this the UI is required to hold
the vat lock before calling into the ingredient. This is currently
handled by a "wrapper" class that sits between the UI code and the
ingredient, and locks the vat before relaying the UI's request. When
the ingredient calls the UI it is the UI's responsibility to avoid
threading problems (the IFC UI code uses the IFC event queue to make
sure all UI changes happen in the IFC thread). One thing the
ingredient does do is clone all the arguments it gives to the UI, and
all the results it returns to the UI; this ensures that the UI and the
ingredient never hold onto a common instance of a mutable object
(e.g. an AvatarPage).

<h5>Registering For Address Book Changes</h5>

Other avatar ingredients can register with the address book in order
to be notified when the address book changes. This interface doesn't
cover all possible address book changes, but you can find out if the
local avatar's description changes (name changes are one especially
important example), or if a privilege changes (e.g. you decide to
prevent avatar X from sending you telepathy).

<h5>Secure Address Book Update</h5>

The address book uses the identity secure capability exchange protocol
to query other avatars' address books and get their latest address book
information. It is a slightly odd use of the protocol because it is
used to return a data structure rather than a capability, but it does
ensure that the data is communicated securely between the avatars.
<p>
This is how the "online" indicator in the address book works; if the
capability exchange fails due to a network error the target avatar is
assumed to be offline.

<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>The address book ingredient code assumes it will only be
accessed by one thread at a time, so it doesn't do any locking
of its state.
</ul>


<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

I'm going to cop out here and point you at the source. The source is
fairly well commented and has been reviewed (by Walendo and Dima) so
I hope it's easy enough to understand. Unfortunately it's all E and
Pluribus code, so I can't get JavaDoc for it, which is what I'd prefer
to use in this section.
<p>
Anyway, here are the important files:

<dl>

<dt>cosm1/ui/presenter/steward/AddressBook.java
<dd>This file contains the interfaces between UI and ingredient, and also
the AvatarPage and LocalAvatarPage classes.

<dt>cosm1/ui/presenter/crew/AddressBookWrapper.java
<dd>Simple class which sits between the UI and the ingredient, and ensures
that the vat is locked before the UI thread calls into the ingredient.

<dt>cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar/AvatarAddressBook_kind.plu
<dd>The address book ingredient interfaces, as exposed to neighboring
ingredients. Read this file before looking at the state bundle and the
implementation.

<dt>cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar/AvatarAddressBook_state.plu
<dd>The address book ingredient state bundle

<dt>cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar/AvatarAddressBook_impl.plu
<dd>The address book ingredient implementation. This is big -
probably too big. I'm not sure how to modularize it though.

</dl>

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<ul>
<li>Turn on the "addressbook" trace category to get address book tracing.
When it is turned on the address book will print out trace message and
check itself for consistency after most operations.
</ul>


<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Resolved Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>The address book used to have even more functionality - groups,
and the "friends list", a list of avatars which was going to be
used in some parts of the UI (e.g. in a pull down menu for telepathy).
I removed all this code a few weeks before alpha. Should groups and
the friends list ever return I wouldn't recommend resurrecting the code
it as it was, as I think my design was poor. 
</ul>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>The UI and ingredient currently use names to communicate i.e. they
identify avatars by giving names. This is wrong because they are in
different threads, so there can be races when a name changes. They
should identify avatars by using identity objects. This is a lot
simpler now we've got rid of crew/guest distinctions (identities,
being guest, couldn't be given to crew code). Unfortunately I didn't
have time to fix this before Alpha.
<li>The address book and some of its neighbor ingredients are linked
by circular neighbor statements at the moment. The address book is a
fairly low level avatar utility, used by many higher level
ingredients. But it also calls out into some higher level ingredients
in order to send mail, start a telepathy balloon etc.  This should be
fixed, probably by providing a registration and callback style
interface e.g. a "register service" interface where you specify a
service type (email, telepathy, visit turf, vox chat) and a handler to
be called when the service is needed.

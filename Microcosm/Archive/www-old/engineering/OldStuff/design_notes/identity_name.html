<H1>Identity Naming</H1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The identity naming package gives a way to associate user visible
names with identity objects (see <A href="identity.html">Identity</a>
for more on identity objects). Identity objects often represent
something that is interesting to the user - e.g. in Microcosm avatars
have identities. But users don't want to see the sturdy refs of
identities in the UI - they are long, random and confusing. So we need
a way to map identities to names and vice versa.
<p>
Another problem is that the owner of the identity may want to
change the name associated with the identity over time. For example,
suppose an avatar is initially called Fred. But over time the owner
of the avatar develops the character of the avatar and wants him
to be known as Frederick the Great. This could be confusing to
people who have previously met the Fred avatar. How do they know
Frederick the Great is really Fred, particularly as his appearance
may have changed? And, if there happen to be two Frederick the
Greats, how does the user know which is which?
<p>
The avatar naming package solves this problem by maintaining two names
for an identity. One, the <em>handle</em>, is the name chosen by the
owner of the identity. The other, the <em>nick name</em>, is chosen by
the user who views the identity. Nick names are guaranteed to be
unique, per viewer (i.e. as a viewer, I can't use the same nick name for
two identies). When displaying an identity to the user both names are
used, in the format "nick name {handle}" e.g. Fred {Frederick the Great}.
One special case: if the nick name and handle are identical, then just
one name is used e.g. Jill rather than Jill {Jill}.
<p>
The avatar naming package provides ways of manipulating nick names
and handles and ways of associating identities with nick names in
a name table.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

IdentityName is a simple class which contains a handle and a nick name. It
provides static utilities for checking that handles and nick names are well
formed and also has accessors to get at the handle, the nick name and
the full name, i.e. "nick name {handle}". IdentityNames are immutable (modulo
some internal caching).
<p>
An IdentityNameTable maps SturdyIdentity objects to IdentityName
objects and vice versa. This mapping is really between nick names and
SturdyIdentity objects, because the nick name part of the IdentityName
is unique within an IdentityNameTable, whereas there may be several
IdentityNames with the same handle. The IdentityNameTable allows you
to change nick names (if the user decides on a new nick name for an
identity) and to update handles (if the owner of the identity decides
to change its name). When a new SturdyIdentity/handle pair is added to
the IdentityNameTable it automatically generates a unique nick name
based on the handle. e.g. If the handle was Mary the nick name would
probably just be Mary too, unless the nick name Mary is in use in
which case Mary-1, Mary-2 or something similar would be used.
<p>
An IdentityNameRef is an object that represents a mapping between an
Identity name and an identity, in the context of an IdentityNameTable
If you have a reference to an IdentityNameRef then you can get at the
actual SturdyIdentity object and at the IdentityName for that
identity. IdentityNameRefs are reference counted. As long as someone
holds on to the IdentityNameRef then the corresponding IdentityNameTable
will maintain the corresponding nick name to identity mapping. When the
last reference is dropped the IdentityNameTable moves the mapping onto
a "recent list" and will eventually drop it all together, on a
least recently used basis. Holding an IdentityNameRef does not allow
you to change the nick name or handle of the identity; for that you need
a reference to the IdentityNameTable.

<h5>Example - Use in Microcosm</h5>

Microcosm currently uses a single IdentityNameTable for avatar
names. So, for example, whenever you enter a region you are notified
of the identities and latest handles of any avatars in that
region. These identities are looked up in the IdentityNameTable. If
you've encountered them already their handles are updated (if they've
changed) and the existing nick name is used. If you've never
encountered them, new nick names are generated (often just the handle,
but sometimes the handle plus a -<number> suffix e.g Jill-2).
<p>
Any parts of the UI that need to display the avatar names - e.g. the
address book, the labels, speech balloons - are given
IdentityNameRefs, from which they can extract the full avatar
namne. As long as the UI code hangs on to its IdentityNameRef it can
always get at the current avatar name, even if the handle or nick name
changes.
<p>
The address book ingredient keeps a reference to the
IdentityNameTable.  It uses this to change nick names and handles, as
needed. If you explicitly put an avatar in your address book, the page
for that avatar will keep an IdentityNameRef around, guaranteeing that
the avatar will keep the same nick name (unless you manually change
it).
<p>
If you just encounter an avatar and don't put it in your address book
its nick name will end up on the recent list and will, eventually, be
discarded (unless you re-encounter the avatar, which would promote it
out of the recent list). The address book uses a fairly long recent
list so it's pretty likely that if you re-encounter an avatar it will
be given the same name, even if you haven't put it in your address
book. Sending telepathy to an avatar temporarily promotes its name
mapping out of the recent list, which also makes it more likely that
its nick name won't change.

<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>The IdentityNameTable itself should only be modified in the E run
thread; it is not thread safe.
<li>IdentityNameRefs and IdentityNames can be safely handed to other
threads because they are immutable (or at least only mutable via their
package interfaces, which are only exposed to the IdentityNameTable).
Special care is taken to ensure that finalization of IdentityNameRefs
is deferred to the E run thread, because it may involve an update to
the IdentityNameTable.
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

See the <a HREF="identity/packages.html">JavaDoc</a> for the Identity
and IdentityName packages.

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<ul>
<li>Turn on trace category "identityname" to get details of what the
IdentityNameTable is up to.
</ul>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>Should IdentityNames have a (private) reference back to their
table? At the moment two IdentityNames from different tables could
compare equal (because they have the same nick name).
<li>IdentityNameRefs can probably be implemented more simply via
some kind of weak reference in Java 1.2.
<li>Should the recent list be an optional part of the IdentityNameTable,
rather than being built in as it is now? I suspect setting a recent
list of 0 will break.
<li>Is it overkill to use a heap algorithm in the recent list?
</ul>

<h1>Pluribus Run Time and Compiler Re-Engineering</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Pluribus reengineering effort has resulted in a new set of run time
classes (fondly termed "Plubar" for "PLUribused Beyond All Recognition")
which are much simpler than the previous run time classes and which will
obviate the need for a Pluribus compiler completely.  Pluribus will no
longer be a language in and of itself and has become merely the
Unum/Presence/Ingredient model around which we have designed the new,
100% Java (so far) classes.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

The new Plubar model is based upon a table-driven unum which routes
messages to its constituent ingredients using the names of methods and
the ingredients to which they are sent.

<p>

Creating a Plubar unum consists of two steps; 1) defining the structure of the
unum and 2) creating an instance of an unum with the defined structure.

<p>

The definition of an unum is handled in a new run time class called,
surprisingly enough, UnumDefinition, which contains the structural
information about an unum.  This class consists mainly of four tables
and interfaces for modifying them.  The first table contains a list of
ingredients in this unum definition stored as Strings.  These Strings
are just the names or roles of the ingredients and do not signify any
Class or Interface.  The next three tables hold routing information for
unum, host presence and client presence messages respectively.  The
tables are based on pairs of Strings, the name of the message and the
name of the target ingredient to which the message is to be delivered.
Note that an UnumDefinition contains information only, and not any
actual instances of objects which would force some sort of
implementation.

<p>

The Unum class contains an UnumDefinition and a table of actual Java
objects linked to the role names of the ingredients in the
UnumDefinition.  To create an instance of a defined unum, you
instantiate an Unum with an UnumDefinition and then initialize each of
the ingredient roles with an instance of a Java Object.  This Object can
be a normal Java Class or an E Class (until E goes away, of course).

<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

Getting rid of Pluribus compiler.<p>

Getting rid of Pluribus language.<p>

Simplifying the interface for the Pluribus programmer.<p>

Cleaning up the Pluribus run time.<p>

Reducing RAM bloat: The unum definition for, say, Prop can be written
and compiled <b>one time</b> and all of the naming and routing info for
any Prop is stored in a central place rather than being copied into
every instance of a Prop unum.<p>

Reducing Class bloat: All kinds of una are now just instances of class
Unum, rather than being GenericProp$ui, Sticky3DFloor$ui, etc.<p>

<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

For now, this section simply provides links to Javadoc created pages for
the new ec.plubar:

<A href="ec.plubar.Unum.html">Unum</a><p>
<A href="ec.plubar.UnumDefinition.html">UnumDefinition</a><p>
<p>

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

Currently (2/26/98) there is one example for testing purposes in
<b>ec3/Pluribus/Runtime/Plubar/Tests</b> which consists of a
simple Unum with a Color Ingredient and a Shape Ingredient and about 10
messages delivered betwixt them.

<p>

I am about to start work on converting the Prop and Swatch una to Plubar
notation, along with a few of their ingredients.

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Resolved Issues</h4>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

*** Remove last array (myIngredientRoles[]) from UnumDefinition ***<p>

Add/replace methods for tweaking message routing<p>

Redirecting messages a la original <b>"deliver foo to bar"</b>
methodology<p>

Defining and creating una in one line per Crock's <b>"keep life simple
for the average unum programmer"</b> proposal; should probably be
done by adding a level of indirection, i.e. a tool which makes several
Plubar calls for the programmer.<p>

<H1>Arturo's Facet Mechanism</H1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This design note explains the "facet" objects Arturo designed as part of the
redesign of the core Microcosm ingredients. 

<p>
In the long term facets will be a Pluribus feature. If you have a
facet to an unum you will be able to use only a subset of the unum's
kinds. So, for example, you might have a facet to a box unum which
allows you to carry the box around, but doesn't let you open
it. Facets are "capabilities"; they give you the capability to do a
set of operations on an object. Without an appropriate facet you can't
access the object. With the facet you can only use the operations
allowed by that facet.

<p>
As Pluribus doesn't implement facets yet, Arturo has implemented a kind
of facets using E. Arturo's facets are, in fact, what we have been
calling "revokable forwarders". A revokable forwarder is rather like
the "proxy" design pattern. A forwarder points to a "subject"
object. If you have a handle to the forwarder you can use it to
forward messages to the subject. But the forwarder doesn't expose the
full abilities of the subject; it only forwards a restricted subset of
the subject's messages. In addition, the subject has a pointer to a
secret "revoke" method in the forwarder. The subject can call this
method to disable the forwarder; once it has been revoked the
forwarder can no longer reach its subject and is useless.

<p>
So if your only reference to an object is via a revokable forwarder
you have strictly controlled access to that object. You can call only
the operations allowed by the forwarder. And if the object revokes
your forwarder you can no longer affect (or access) the object at all.

<p>
As you can see, facets and revokable forwarders are closely
related. In fact the only difference I can think of between a
forwarders and facets is that if you have an unum and a facet of the
same unum you can tell that the unum and the facet are "the same
thing" (i.e. they are different ways of looking at the same object).
But if you have a revokable forwarder to an unum and an unum there is
no way of telling if the forwarder points to that unum.

<p>
For the rest of this document the term facet will be used to
mean "revokable forwarder" (this is a bit confusing; but the current
revokable forwarder implementations are called facets in the code, so
its a confusion we'll have to live with).

<h2>Presence Facet</h2>

The presence facet is a simple, but ingenious, pattern. An Unum
presence creates an E object which has access to its presence methods
(these presence methods are not exposed to other una or presences
within the una, unless the unum writer decides to expose them). This
new E object is the presence facet.

<p>
The presence facet has a pointer to the presence, and it implements
set of E methods which it forwards to the presence. In addition the
facet has a Java "revoke" method. The implementation of the revoke
method nulls out the facet's presence pointer, so it can no longer
access the presence.

<p>
The presence retains a pointer to the facet, so it can call "revoke" at
any time. It can do this because it has a direct Java pointer to the facet.
As long as it doesn't give this pointer to anyone else, noone else can revoke
the facet.

<p>
The presence can give the presence facet to other presences of the same unum.
As the other presencies are in different agencies (by definition) they don't
get direct pointers to the facet. Instead, by the normal E mechanisms, they
get E proxies to the facet. They can use these proxies to send E messages
to the facet, which will then forward them to the original presence. But
the other proxies cannot access the Java "revoke" method; that's only
available if you have a pointer to the actual facet; a proxy won't do.
And only the original presence has a pointer to the actual facet.

<p>
So the presence facet has the properties we needed from a revokable
forwarder.  It only allows access to a restricted set of the original
presence's operations. And the original presence (and only the original
presence) can revoke it at will.


<h2>Unum Facets</h2>

The unum facets are more complex and more ingenious than the presence
facets. As you know, for unum A to send a message to unum B there must
be presences of unum A and unum B in the same agency. The presence of
unum A sends a message which is routed to the local presence of unum
B. If B is a client/server unum the presence of B will either forward
the message to the server or process it and update the clients.

<p>
When unum A uses an unum facet to talk to unum B the process is a
little more complex. A talks to the unum facet. The unum facet
forwards the message to the local presence of B. If the local presence
of B is a client it then uses a presence facet to talk to the server
presence of B.

<p>
So how do you set up an unum facet? It's a two stage process. First
the server presence of unum B sets up a presence facet to itself. Any
presence of unum B that gets this facet could use it to send (a
controlled set of) messages to the server presence of B. But B doesn't
hand out the facet freely.  Instead it wraps it in an envelope by
doing something like:

<p><code>
  envelope <- uLocalSetPresenceFacet(presenceFacet);
</code><p>

All the other presences of unum B accept the "uLocalSetPresenceFacet"
message. When they get it they take the "presenceFacet" argument and
store it, so they can use it to talk to the server presence. But
remember, they haven't been sent this message yet, so for now they're
powerless to affect the server presence....

<p>
Now it's time to make the unum facet. It is given a pointer to unum B
and the envelope, which it keeps as its state. Like the presence
facet, the unum facet it mainly a forwarder. It takes the (controlled
set of) messages it allows and forwards them to the unum.

<p>
The real magic comes when you pass the unum facet to another agency.
Though the unum facet is an E object it does not create a proxy to
itself when it is passed over the wire. Instead it has special encode
and decode procedures so that it gets copied. The encode procedure
just encodes the unum and the envelope. The decode procedure first
decodes the unum (thereby creating a local presence of B, if there
isn't one there already). Then it sends the envelope to the local
presence, thus giving the local presence the presence capability
(which was the argument in the envelope).

<p>
So passing someone an unum facet ensures that:
<ul>
<li>They'll have a presence of the corresponding unum on their agency
<li>That presence will have the appropriate presence facet for talking
    to the server presence
</ul>
Note that you'll end up with multiple copies of the unum facet on the
different agencies, all pointing (via their local presences, which
hold proxies) to the original presence facet.

<p>
To revoke an unum facet the presence can just revoke the original
presence facet. This effectively revokes all the unum facet copies
that point at that presence facet (the unum facets can still forward
their messages but they'll be forwarding them to a revoked presence
facet so it doesn't matter).

<H1>The 1997 PCForum Demo Token Unum</H1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This design note explains the Demo Token Unum and key related
ingredients used in Microcosm for the March 1997 PCForum.

<h1>Overview</h1>

This Token Unum is a very simple unum tailored for the Demo
to support spending. 
<p>
The Token unum behaves like a debit-card. Its current value
is decremented by the price of an item rented from the Demo
Vending Machine.

<h1>Token Unum Details</h1>

The Token Unum is a Prop derivative. 

It adds only one unum method beyond what it inherits from Prop:

<p><code>
  uSpend(int amount)
</code><p>

where <code>amount</code> represents the price of the vended item. 

<h1>Ingredient Details</h1>

<h2>Token</h2>

The Token ingredients are a client/server pair. The
server is initialized with one state variable:

<ul>
<li> <code>int tokenAmount;</code>
</ul>

where <code>tokenAmount</code> represents the current value of the
token. A condition related to <code>tokenAmount</code> is that
it always be non-negative, implying that it cannot be used to
rent an item whose price is greater than the <code>tokenAmount</code>.

<p>

If the client ingredient receives the <code>uSpend</code>, it forwards
the <code>amount</code> to the server ingredient by calling
the server (host presence) method:

<p><code>
  pSpend(int amount)
</code><p>

This method simply calls the server method:

<p><code>
  uSpend(int amount)
</code><p>
 
passing the amount. The server <code>uSpend</code> method decrements
the <code>tokenAmount</code> by the spent <code>amount</code>. 


<h2>UIToken</h2>

The UIToken ingredient is a derivative of the UIProp ingredient.
The only differece (intended) is that the <code>label</code> 
command for Token display the <code>tokenAmount</code> along
with the basic Token description.

<h1>Problems</h1>

<ul>

<li> The display of the value in the label (via calls to
init to adjust the value) was not implemented. The value
was shown in spam after each rental.
<p>
<li> There is no security control over the token including 
minting/copying and setting value. 
<p>
<li>
No checks were made on the argument to <code>uSpend</code>
or on the state variable <code>tokenValue</code>:
<ul> 
<p>
<li>The intended non-negative value condition for 
<code>tokenValue</code> was not enforced [and because
also the vending machine didn't have access to the value of the
token, spending was always allowed].  
<p>
<li>
 There was no check that the amount spent is positive, so
a call to <code>uSpend</code> with a negative argument would
increase the <code>tokenValue</code>.
</ul>
<p>
<li> The initial value of <code>tokenValue</code> was always set 
in the host presence init to 9999, ignoring the intended initial
value set via the realm text file.
<p>
<li> Only one size of token was supported. 
<p>
<li> Merge and split commands are not supported. 
<p>
<li> There is no sound when spending. Sound was intended
for spending, merging, and splitting.

</ul>

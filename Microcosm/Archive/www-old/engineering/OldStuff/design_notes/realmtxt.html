The Unum Instantiation and Destruction System

REALMTEXT

RealmText is a text format for specifying data used to instantiate an Unum.

A typical RealmText entry is as follows:

RealmVersion "RealmText Version 0.3, 10 March 1997"
Create Realm 
	Name "Beta Turf"
	ScreenWidth 640
	ScreenHeight 480
	Create Region
		Name "Aztec"
		DefaultPad "Aztec"
		Horizon 234
		Description "This is your turf. The latest in Neo-Aztec design. Click on the radio for more help."
		URL "http://beta.communities.com"
		BBS "http://beta.communities.com"
		Watermark "watermarks/DefaultWatermark.bmp"
		Create Unum TeleportPad
			Name "Aztec"
			Description "Aztec Turf"
			ImageFile "Misc/TransNoPick.appearance2D"
			Position 0 0 0
			Scale .01
			FinalEntryPosition 0 6 0
			UnumCreatorClass "ec.cosm.agency.TeleportPadCreator"
			ForceListing
		End Unum
	End Region
End Realm

In general, a "Create" statement indicates that an object is to be
instantiated from the data that follows.  In the case of "Create Realm"
however, this is not true, as the Realm is always created specially.

A "Create" statement that appears within the scope of another "Create"
statement indicates containership, or in the case of the Realm and Regions,
the RegionContainment relationship.

RealmText is parsed by the ec.cosm.tools.parser.RealmParser class.  If 
you have an UnumFactory instance, you can call 
unumFactory.readUnumData(..) 
with either a filename or stream to retrieve the parsed form of a 
RealmText file: a nested structure of Hashtables and Vectors.  Each 
Hashtable holds the data for a single object, represented in terms of 
several basic types that the parser understands.  For example, some 
of the data for the "TeleportPad" object above might be:

key						value
java.lang.String	"name"			java.lang.String			"aztec"
java.lang.String	"position"		ec.misc.graphics.Point3D	[0, 0, 0]

The Hashtables of data for the various objects are nested according to 
containment.  For example, in the Hashtable of data for the "Realm" object,
under the standard key "regionvector", there will be a Vector of Hashtables
of data for "Region" objects.  The Hashtables for the Regions in turn have
a key "unumvector" that maps to a Vector of Hashtables of data of contained
Unums.

TODO: eliminate fixed Realm/Region/Container/Unum hierarchy, change the 
standard keys to just "contents".

REALMTEXT "FORGING"

The parsed result of RealmText (a Hashtable of variously typed data indexed by
java.lang.Strings) is very easy to "forge", ie construct by hand.

Parsed RealmText data used for the initial creation of the AvatarBody is forged
in the ec.cosm.objects.agent.MCUnumFactory.

INSTANTIATION: THE UNUMFACTORY AND THE UNUMCREATIONCONTEXT

A Hashtable of data for a single object requires context information to actually
become a functioning Unum: capabilities to the Unum's immediate container, the 
Unum's realm, and in the case of a portal, the other portals in the realm it needs 
to link with.  This context information becomes the 
ec.cosm.objects.agent.UnumCreationContext
An UnumCreationContext is created with a Realm Unum and various capabilities 
necessary during instantiation.

TODO: eliminate use of Realm Unum, replace with a capability group

An UnumCreationContext also contains a stack of ContainerContext objects (initially
empty) that represent levels of containment.  A ContainerContext is created with
a CapabilityGroup for the container it represents.

TODO: right now a ContainerContext can also be created with just a kind ukAddUnum
facet, which is probably wrong.

An UnumCreationContext is made ready for instantiation by calling 
UnumCreationContext.setDataTable(Hashtable data);
with a Hashtable of data for a single Unum.  The UnumCreationContext provides
typed access to the data table it holds.

TODO: separate out the creation context from the data table with typed accessors.

An UnumCreationContext primed with the data for a single object can be passed to 
ec.cosm.objects.agent.UnumFactory.createUnum(UnumCreationContext context);
to create a single Unum.  Note that UnumFactory is an interface that
ec.cosm.objects.agent.MCUnumFactory implements.

A hierarchy of RealmText data where the top level Hashtable is the data from
the Realm object can be passed to
UnumFactory.createContainerTree(UnumCreationContext context,
                                Hashtable realmData,
                                ...)
to create any number of objects and have them arrange themselves in the 
containment relationships implied by the scoping in RealmText.  This method
automatically handles arbitrary levels of recursive containment under the 
Realm.

The UnumFactory from the outside is a lot like the "Abstract Factory" pattern.
On the inside, the UnumFactory is a seething pit of Pluribus workarounds and
unrelated hacks that were attracted by existing hacks.

TODO: Whatever the replacement for RealmText, if any, the UnumFactory should 
become nothing more than a dispatch center that calls some kind of a per-unum-
class construction code.  The dispatch should probably be done on classname 
via class.forName().

TODO: Note that the problem being solved is construction of a composite object,
and the current solution is to have all composite objects have a single argument 
constructor where the argument is actually an object that can be queried for
actual arguments.  The single argument is the UnumCreationContext and the
"constructor"s are the functions that form the body of the UnumFactory.

TURFS, REALMS AND THE REALM UNUM

From the software's standpoint, a Realm is a set of regions.  A Turf is a 
Realm created from the Turf catalog.

There is also a Realm Unum.  There is only one Realm Unum, it is created at 
initial startup and never destroyed (like the Avatar).  When Realms and 
Turfs are created and destroyed, various Unums within the Realm (for example
regions and portals) register and unregister with the Realm Unum.

At startup, a Realm is created.  The regions in this Realm can never be 
destroyed, although the Inventory can be used to destroy almost all other
objects in this initial Realm.

THE CATALOG

The Catalog is an ingredient in the avatar Unum called "AvatarCatalog".
Source is in 
cosm1/object/ingredients/avatar

Two presenters are used for the Catalog: the GUICatalogListPresenter and
the GUICatalogPresenter.  Source is in 
cosm1/ui/gui/uipresenter

The GUICatalogListPresenter just scans the "catalog" directory and lists
all files who's names are of the form "catalog.*.txt", and lists them.
Note there can be any number of catalogs of any type.

TODO: Create a catalogIndex.txt readable by java.util.Properties, and use 
it as the list of catalogs.

When the user selects a catalog to open, the Catalog uses the 
UnumFactory.readUnumData methods to load RealmText files, and does some 
minor munging of the parsed RealmText to fill a CatalogData object, which
the Catalog shares with the GUICatalogPresenter.  The CatalogData object 
just holds the parsed form of RealmText with some intervening structural 
objects that also have some information cached for the presenter and some
information only used by the presenter.  

Source for the CatalogData and the structural objects mentioned above is in 
cosm1/ui/presenter/steward

The GUICatalogPresenter presents the data in the RealmText file as a list 
of objects divided into "tabs".  Tabs correspond to Create Region statements 
in RealmText, and an entire GUICatalogPresenter corresponds to the Create 
Realm scope.  The data from the RealmText file is presented differently
according to the CatalogData object's type: swatch catalog, item catalog,
turf catalog or avatar catalog. 

When the user selects an item to instantiate, the Catalog leverages the 
instantiation logic in the UnumFactory to create Unums on the fly, then 
uses various capabilities over other objects to bring the new Unums into 
the world appropriately (according to type).

This is done differently for each catalog type as follows:

Items/Swatches
--------------
Objects are instantiated into the pocket, then moved into the avatar's hand.
If there is a TOS failure (or other, possibly bogus failure) on the move to 
the hand, the object ends up in the avatar's pocket.

TODO: Instantiate into null container, then move to hand.  Very very easy,
essentially just a removal of code, was implemented at one point, but 
breaks the current container of last resort model, where an object's initial
container is it's container of last resort.

Avatars
-------
Although the avatar body created on a normal initial startup is actually 
made from "forged" RealmText (see above), data for instantiating avatar
bodies can be specified in RealmText, and this is done for Avatar catalogs.

The Avatar catalog really creates an AvatarBody Unum, not an Avatar Unum.
The body is created into a NULL container, then swapped with the Avatar's
current body by way of an interface in AvatarBodyLink in
src/cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar
The Catalog then destroys the old avatar body.

Turfs
-----
A Turf Catalog RealmText file does not actually contain data to create Unums.
Instead, "Create Unum" statements in a Turf Catalog contain a special key 
"RealmTextFile" that is the name of another RealmText file with the actual
data for a Turf, that is, data that when parsed can be passed to 
UnumFactory.createContainerTree();

If the user has previously created a Turf using the Turf Catalog, when a new
Turf is created the previous turf is destroyed.  Turf destruction consists of
deleting all regions, portals, props, etc, that were created as part of the
Turf; this can include things that the user has since moved out of the Turf
(although a well designed turf should probably have no moveable objects), but
will not include objects that the user created separately and moved into her
turf.

SWATCH IMPORT

Everything happens in AvatarCatalog_ingr.plu, uImportItem()

Once the user has chosen a bitmap (.bmp) to import, the catalog loads the 
bitmap from disk and does various bogosity checks on it.  Those bogosity 
checks do not currently include a full format check, but should.

The resulting byte array, if valid, is given to the PublishRepository, which
stores it, sets it up to be externally downloadable, and returns a DataHolder 
to it (all as the result of one call).

An entry in the current catalog for the Swatch is forged (see forging 
RealmText above).  

As the swatch is created, it is actually swatched itself with the same 
texture it swatches with, by applying a TextureStructure (see Robj).  

THE INVENTORY

The Inventory is really the AvatarInventory ingredient in the Avatar Unum.
Source is in cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar

When the UnumFactory creates an object, it sends the UnumSoul of that object to 
the Inventory.  Since the Inventory is created after the UnumFactory, this is
done with a channel who's distributor is given to the Inventory when the Avatar
is instantiated.

TODO: somehow make this mechanism synchronous.  Otherwise, messages with Unum's
being sent to the Inventory can be left undelivered if serialization occurs
while the message is sitting in the channel.

The Inventory gets the Unum for that UnumSoul and tries to get a description for
that object from the Composition system, or failing that, the Describer ingredient.
It stores any retrieved information in an InventoryDescription object, and 
maintains two parallel Hashtables, one of SoulStates (retrieved from UnumSouls) 
of Unums, and one of InventoryDescriptions.  The tables are keyed by 
java.lang.Long objects, created in sequence.

TODO: The Inventory ignores certain types of objects that the user shouldn't
be able to delete from the Inventory, such as Regions and the current AvatarBody.
Really, those objects should either be kept but not displayed to the user or
should be displayed to the user with most operations inactive.  If the Inventory
can gather every last object, a separate mechanism of tracking all objects for
serialization can be eliminated (see Arturo).

The table of descriptions is given to the GUIInventoryPresenter.  When the 
GUIInventoryPresenter needs to do an operation on an Unum in the Inventory it
refers to the Unum by it's java.lang.Long key.

Remove
------
This just leverages the UnumSoul.kill() facility to completely destroy the host
presence of an Unum.

Modify
------
Sends a message to the PropertyManager's Unum-level interface to invoke a Property
Sheet.

Recover
-------
Checks if an Unum is nailed down by looking at the state bundle for the Unum's
Portability ingredient.  If the object is not nailed down, retrieves a capability
to arbitrarily change the Unum's container from the CapabilityGroup in the Unum's
SoulState, and changes the Unum's container to the Pocket.

UNUM DELETION CLEANUP

Killing an Unum means destroying the host presence of the Unum in addition to all
clients, freeing all resources and garbage collecting all objects.

TODO: No one has looked closely to my knowledge, but UnumKilling probably doesn't
accomplish all of the above right now.

You can kill an Unum if you have access to its ec.pl.runtime.UnumSoul.  You can 
gain access to any Unum's UnumSoul if you have the ec.pl.runtime.UnumMaster 
capability; then you simply call unumSoul.kill()

There are two types of notification of UnumKill.  If you are an ingredient in an
Unum being killed, you can implement the interface ec.pl.runtime.UnumKillHandler,
which contains one method, noteUnumKilled(void), that will be called when the Unum
is killed.

If you have access to an Unum's UnumSoul, you can register to be notified when 
the Unum is deleted.  The interface you implement is UnumKillInterest, and the
single method in this interface is noteUnumKilled(SoulState forIdentification). 

Various subsystems use UnumKill notification for cleanup, although many subsystems
don't do so and need to.

When a containable is deleted, it removes itself from it's container.

When a container is deleted, it ejects its contents, and the contents wind up in
their container of last resort.

When teleport pads are deleted, they unregister themselves with both the Avatar
and the Realm.

The Inventory registers interest in UnumKill notification for all Unums it tracks,
and removes any killed Unums from its list.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The Catalog
-----------
Really, the Catalog should be either a database or filesystem.

Users should be able to add new items to catalogs, through both external tools 
and in-world mechanisms (like swatch import).  Users should be able to create
their own arbitrary groupings of items, and destroy existing ones.  Users should
be able to merge in other user's catalogs or items, through both in-world and 
out-of-world mechanisms.

There are two ways to do this: if you make the catalog a database, then there
are a bunch of items and a bunch of heavily overlapping groupings of items.
The same item can exist in more than one group.

If you make the catalog a filesystem, then there are groupings of items that
contain the one and only instance of those items - if you want the same item  
in two groups, you copy it.  This is less powerful and less space efficient, but 
easier to understand than a database.  By using tricks like only duplicating an 
item when the data for its representation in a group is edited (rather than 
when it is added to new groups) you could implement the UI as a filesystem and 
the mechanism as a database. 

If everything is editable by default, there will need to be a notion of a read-only
catalog that EC or a hub might distribute.  Read-only catalogs would be fixed 
and uneditable, and would receive regular updates that overwrite earlier versions.
If users want to create custom versions of items in uneditable catalogs, they can 
create copies that are editable.

Note that there is dormant code in the Catalog for loading RealmText from the
Repository.  This code was at one point the active and checked in version, but 
there are a couple of problems: 
1. The cycle for testing new RealmText becomes tedious, more complicated, and
error prone.
2. You can't get names of Catalogs for free by using names of files, so you
have to create an additional chunk of data that acts as an index of catalogs.

Trimming the Catalog
--------------------
Once parsed RealmText data is loaded by the catalog, it is stored in the 
Catalog's state bundle and serialized.  It could, instead, be reloaded from 
RealmText after revival the next time the user opens that catalog - the actual
RealmText parsing time is nearly neglible next to image loading time for most
catalogs.  If this were done, imported swatches and any other modifiable objects
in the catalog would require some special handling.  Note that since the 
Catalog's data is accessed only when the Catalog is instantiating something, 
this would probably not help the working set.

Alternately, the Catalog could have an external storage format that it saves
in whenever the user makes changes, and the Catalog could share that format
with external tools (this is basically the database/filesystem suggestion 
above).  This is the right thing in the long run.

Certification
-------------
I think that the Catalog is the right place to introduce certification to the
user, although the process is going to be more complicated than pressing a
button to certify something.  There will probably need to be an entirely
separate "Certifier" class or set of classes to handle the certification 
process.  The Certifier needs to do all of:

1) Teach the user about what certification means (probably by pointing to the web)
2) Retrieve an index of Certifying agencies from somewhere and point to web pages
for each.  Those pages would describe the criteria on which the agencies certify,
and explain the fees and terms, if any, for certification.
3) Submit an object for certification to some agency and be able to notify the
user when a response is received, and associate the resulting certificate with the
object it certifies in the Catalog's data.  All editing tools need to be aware of
certification as well, as certified objects or object in the middle of being
certified should not be editable.
4) Contact remote realms and query them for their current policies.
5) Possibly have facilities for getting new certificates propagated to various hubs,
ftp sites, etc.

Note that you could do the entire certification process via the web if you were
willing to complicate the process a bit, requiring the user to take some kind of
"import" action on the certificate once received.

Avatars, Realms and Hubs
------------------------
At various points in the software, both the Avatar and Realm Unums are assumed
to have full power over a process/hub/agent.  Really, there should be a separation of
authority where the Realm holds all capabilities over all hosted objects and
the Avatar holds all capabilities over the UI.  The Avatar's status with respect
to his home Realm should be as an object that, through whatever mechanism, 
has a series of closely held capabilities over the Realm.

With this kind of separation it should become possible to start a Realm without
an Avatar, and to give out admin rights to Avatars and even to adminstrative 
applications that don't have an Avatar Unum (eg admin from the web).

In particular this means that the Catalog and Inventory should be part of the
Realm (and/or just be separate objects not directly accessible to the Avatar)
that any Avatars communicate with via a facet.

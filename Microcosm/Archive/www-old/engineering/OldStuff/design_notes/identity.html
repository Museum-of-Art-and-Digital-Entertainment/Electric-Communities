<h2>Introduction</h2>

An identity object is a way for a group of related objects to use a
single object as a public face to the world. This single object is the
"identity" of the group of related objects. Because E object
references are distributed, persistent and unforgeable you can keep a
reference to an identity object and know that you can get back in
touch with that object without anyone being able to intercept your
messages.
<p>
An identity object provides ways of requesting capabilities and
dropping off capabilities. This, coupled with its unforgeability,
means an identity can build up a reputation. e.g. I gave this
identity these capabilities and it used them appropriately so
I'll give it further capabilities (or it abused them so I'll
revoke the ones it has and not give it any more).

<h4>The PO Box Analogy</h4>

This analogy shows how if you have a single point of contact with
someone and you can reliably reach that single point of contact, then
you can use that point of contact when you want to give that person
something. From your point of view the point of contact is, in some
sense, what you trust. An Identity object is a way of representing
such a point of contact in E code. Anyway, on with the analogy:
<p>
Suppose you see an advertisement in a paper which gives a name and PO
box number. You respond to the ad, giving your name and PO box number.
Over time you build up a relationship with the owner of the PO box
(let's call them Alice) by sending mail to each other. One day
you get a letter, purporting to be from Alice, asking for a loan. At
this point you have to decide, based on your correspondence, whether
or not you trust Alice. But one thing you don't have to worry about is
whether the request is really from Alice. You can just send the money
to Alice's PO box, which is your only point of contact. If someone
other than Alice is trying to scam you, all they can achieve is to
give Alice an unexpected loan. (This assumes you can trust the postal
service to deliver your money!).
<p>
Identity works in a similar way. For example, avatars in Microcosm have
an identity object. An avatar's manifestations in the world
(e.g. body, word balloons) are all marked with the avatar's "identity" -
a persistent object reference to its identity object. As with the PO box
example, in Microcosm you come to trust someone who is identified by a
unique (if rather incomprehensible) identifier - an avatar's identity
object is like Alice's PO box number. When you want to
give capabilities to an avatar you give them to the identity object
you have come to trust, just as you would send money to Alice's PO
box.  The E comm system play the part of the trusted postal service;
it makes sure messages you send to an identity object are delivered to
that object and no other.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

There are three main classes in the Identity package; Identity,
IdentityOwner and SturdyIdentity.
<p>
An Identity object is the public face of a group of related objects
(e.g. an avatar). The Identity object itself is given out freely.
Internally it has a reference to an IdentityOwner object. The
IdentityOwner is much more tightly held; it should not be exposed
beyond the group of related objects that the identity represents.
A SturdyIdentity is just a SturdyRef to an Identity object, plus
a name field. I think adding the name field was a mistake (Scott
told me so at the time, but did I listen?).
<p>
An Identity provides two basic functions; capability requests
and capability checking.

<h5>Capability Requests</h5>

A capability request provides a way for an identity to request and
receive a capability from another identity. The request protocol
makes use of a temporary CapabilityReceipt object, which identifies
a particular request. The basic protocol is:
<ol>
<li>Identity A requests the capability from B:
<pre>
  B <- requestCapability(sturdyRefForIdentityA,requestName,data,&receipt);
</pre>
<li>Identity B decides whether or not identity A should be given the
capability. If so B resolves the SturdyRef to A and calls
<pre>
  A <- giveCapability(capability,receiptDistributor)
</pre>
This is the "callback" part of the protocol; B knows that the capability
is going to the identity A and to no other object, something B could not
know if B just "returned" (via a distributor) a value to the original
caller. On receiving this request, A will forward the receipt distributor
to an actual receipt object.
<li>Meanwhile the original caller, presumably one of the objects represented
by identity A, calls on the IdentityOwner to redeem the receipt channel
whose distributor was handed to the original request call. So the full
call sequence on A's side looks like:
<pre>
  CapabilityReceipt receipt;
  SomeCapability capability;
  B <- requestCapability(sturdyRefForIdentityA,requestName,data,&receipt);
  ownerOfA <- getCapability(receipt, &capability);
  ... use capability ...
</pre>
Note that the capability receipt generated when B gave the capability to
A is only useful to an object which can access the IdentityOwner for A.
Only the IdentityOwner for A can extract the capability corresponding to
the receipt.
</ol>
So this protocol guarantees that B can reply to A's request and know
that A, and only A, will get the capability. The capability is only
accessible to one of the objects represented by identity A, i.e.  one
of the objects with access to the IdentityOwner object for A.
<p>
The request name parameter allows a single identity object to handle
requests for many different types of capability. Internally the
Identity object (actually the IdentityOwner object) has a table of
"capability request handlers", keyed by request name. When a request
comes in the Identity looks up the appropriate handler, by request
name. If there is no such handler the request is denied. Otherwise
the request handler is called and it decides whether or not to
give the requested capability to the requesting identity.
<p>
Often, the capability given to the requestor will be a "filler
facet", marked with the identity of the requestor. e.g. suppose
we have two avatars, A and B, and A asked B, via the identity
mechanism, for a telepathy capability. In that case B would
give A a telepathy facet marked with A's identity.
<p>
This means that A would have a facet with a method of the form
<code>sendTelepathy(text)</code>. But the facet, before calling into
whichever part of B dispensed the capability, would add an extra
argument: <code>sendTelepathy(identityA, text)</code>. A would have
no way of sending telepathy except via this facet, which would always
add in A's identity as an argument. So whichever object B has set up
to respond to telepathy can be 100% sure that the telepathy comes from
A and can display it (or refuse to display it) accordingly.

<h5>Capability Checking</h5>

Another service provided by the identity object is capability checking.
This is a way for any object to check whether a given capability belongs
to a given identity. This check is slightly odd, because any identity
could claim to own a capability that doesn't actually belong to it. The
check is really more "if I treat this capability as yours, will you
mind?".
<p>
An example of when this is useful is the current region entry
protocol. In order to enter a region R an avatar A gives the region an
identity object and an entry capability C. The region checks if
identity A should be allowed in. If so it does a capability check - it
asks identity A "does this entry capability (C) belong to you". If A
receives such a request it is in A's interest to only say yes if the
capability really does belong to A; otherwise it will be allowing
some other avatar into the region under A's identity, and risks the
corresponding loss of reputation if the other avatar behaves badly.
Note that if A actually wants to let in another avatar it can always
do so; there is no protocol that can stop something masquerading as
A, if A agrees to the masquerade.
<p>
Anyway the check capability methods are simple. There are methods on
the IdentityOwner allowing objects associated with the identity to
register and unregister capabilities in a set of known capabilities.
Then there are methods on the Identity - i.e.  callable
from anywhere - which can be used to see if a given capability is in
this known set.
<p>
The "is this capability in the set" operation comes in two flavors.
<ol>
<li><code>checkForCapability(capIn, &capChannel)</code>.
If <code>capIn</code> is one of the set then the
<code>&capChannel</code> distributor is forwarded to the same
capability. If not the distributor is left unforwarded and an
exception is ethrown. This version allows you to optimistically send a
message to <code>capChannel</code>; the message will only arrive at
the capability if it does belong to the identity. In an ideal world
this would involve few (if any?) round trips; unfortunately, given our
current E implementation, it actually involves several!
<li><code>confirmCapability(capIn,confirmer)</code>.
In this form the <code>confirmer</code> object is a simple callback object
whose <code>confirmCapability</code> method is called back with true or
false depending on whether <code>capIn</code> is in the set of
registered capabilities. This approach doesn't use channels as elegantly
but avoids some of the hidden round trips.
</ol>


<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Secure identity relies on the security provided by the E runtime and
comm system.
<li>The methods are all assumed to run in the E thread, there is no
synchronization or locking support.
</ul>


<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

Here is the JavaDoc for most of the identity classes. Note that
the eclasses Identity and IdentityOwner have been changed to be simple
Java classes (and their emethods have become public void methods) in
order to make JavaDoc happy.
<p>
<A href="identity/packages.html">JavaDoc for Identity classes</a>

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use trace category "identity" to see some of what goes on in
the identity package (it doesn't tell you much at the moment).
</ul>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>SturdyIdentity should probably not have a name field. Is there any
need for the SturdyIdentity class at all? Should it just be a SturdyRef?
<li>The request/give protocol can be wrapped to hide CapabilityReceipts
from users. The identity ingredient (still in Pluribus code right now)
does this at the moment. Maybe the wrappers should be convenience
functions on IdentityOwner?
<li>The current request/give protocol is very channel based. When we have
new E should we still use the channel approach, or use a simple callback
scheme (you request a capability, you get a callback when it arrives)?
<li>checkCapability and confirmCapability are two ways of doing the
same thing. One should go.
</ul>

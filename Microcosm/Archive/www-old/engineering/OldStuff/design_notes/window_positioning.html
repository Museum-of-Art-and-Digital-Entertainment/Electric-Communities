<h2>Window Positioning in Microcosm</h2>

This document describes Microcosm's mechanism for window positioning,
including automatic positioning and saving/restoring positions.<P>

<h3>ECExternalWindow and WindowPositioner</h3>

ECExternalWindow is our subclass of IFC's ExternalWindow. We made this
subclass to support some window mechanisms beyond what IFC provided,
including tip views and default buttons. Now ECExternalWindow also provides
hooks into the window positioning mechanism. This means to use the window
positioning mechanism your window needs to be an ECExternalWindow. The
stone look window class (SLWindow) is already a subclass of
ECExternalWindow so there's no problem there.<P>

WindowPositioner is an interface defined in Support/ifc/app (the same place
as ECExternalWindow). WindowPositioner provides calls for recommending a
position for a given window, saving the position of a given window,
restoring the saved position of a given window, and a couple of other things.<P>

<h3>Getting the recommended position</h3>

To hook into the positioning mechanism, an ECExternalWindow needs to have a
"positioner", which is an object that implements WindowPositioner. This is
accessed with the typical <code>positioner()/setPositioner()</code> calls. If an
ECExternalWindow just wants to ask for a recommended position, all it needs
is this positioner -- then the recommended position can be obtained with:<P>

<pre>
	Rect recommendedBounds = 
		ecExtWindow.positioner().recommendBounds(ecExtWindow);
</pre>

It's up to the positioner to come up with a good location (given the
window's current size). The initial implementation is very simplistic, but
it can get smarter over time without client windows having to know anything
about it.<P>

For convenience, ECExternalWindow has a <code>setBoundsToRecommended()</code> call that
first gets the recommended bounds as above and then sets the window's
bounds to match, doing appropriate null-checking along the way.<P>

<h3>Saving/restoring the position</h3>

If an ECExternalWindow wants to have its position saved & restored, it
needs both a positioner and a positioningKey. The positioningKey is simply
a string that differentiates this window from other windows. For example,
the positioningKey for the log window is "LOG WINDOW POSITION" and the
positioningKey for the main window is "MAIN WINDOW POSITION". This string
will be written to and read from the human-readable preferences file, so
sensible English phrases are de rigeur. For consistency, it's best if they
are all "[something] POSITION", though no code will break if you make it
something weird. The positioningKey is accessed, unsurprisingly, with
<code>positioningKey()/setPositioningKey()</code>. By default it is null, so you have to
explicitly set one on each window instance whose position you want
saved/restored.<P>

Once you've set the positioner and the positioningKey on an
ECExternalWindow instance, the position saving (but not restoring) is done
automatically. A window's position is saved when it's hidden (specifically
by <code>ECExternalWindow.hide()</code>), and positions of open windows are saved when
Microcosm is quit, more or less. The positioningKeys and positions are
written out into the preferences file, which at least at the moment is
called "Microcosm.prefs" and lives in the directory from which you launched
Microcosm.<P>

You have some choices about how to use the saved position when it comes
time to create your window again in the next life, er, launch. The simplest
thing to do is just to call <code>ecExtWindow.setBoundsToRecommended()</code>, as
mentioned above. This will use the stored position if there is one,
otherwise it will apply its own algorithm to find a place for the window it
likes.<P>

If you don't want to use the window positioner's algorithm, you don't have
to. You can ask for the recommended bounds using
<code>windowPositioner.recommendedBounds(ecExtWindow)</code> and then decide whether to
use the result, or you can just ask for the saved bounds using
<code>windowPositioner.savedBounds(ecExtWindow)</code>. For instance, the log window has
some code to fit itself under the main window and resize itself vertically
depending on how much room there is on the screen. It first checks
<code>savedBounds()</code>. If that's non-null, it uses the result. If savedBounds is
null, it uses its own code to position itself.<P>

Note that you never have to worry about the saved position from a big
monitor not working on a small monitor -- <code>windowPositioner.savedBounds()</code>,
which is called by <code>recommendedBounds()</code>, will move the saved bounds as
necessary to keep it on the screen.<P>

<h3>WindowManager</h3>

So, you ask, where do I get a WindowPositioner so that I can set it for the
ECExternalWindows I create? Well, handily, the GUIFramework object has one
for you. It's of class WindowManager, whose code lives in ui/gui/utils/ if
you're interested. It's included in interface jiGUIFramework along with the
other GUI-only stuff that lots of other classes are interested in. You get
it with <code>getWindowManager()</code> after finding the GUIFramework/jiGUIFramework
object somehow.<P>

<h3>Sample code</h3>

First you need the application's one and only window manager. If you've
already got a jiGUIFramework around, you can get it with:<P>

<pre>
	WindowManager wm = jiGF.getWindowManager();
</pre>

If you haven't got a jiGUIFramework around, you can always find it since
it's the IFC Application and you can reach it through a static method.
Here's the longest and safest way to get it (leaving off any required
import lines):<P>

<pre>
	Application app = Application.application();
	WindowManager wm;
	if (app instanceof jiGUIFramework){
	    wm = ((jiGUIFramework)app).getWindowManager();
	} else {
	    wm = null;
	}
</pre>

Note that the <code>wm = null</code> case should never be hit because there's always
exactly one IFC application (when you're in GUI code, as you are if you're
mucking with ECExternalWindows) and our application is always a
GUIFramework, which implements jiGUIFramework. Therefore you can
realistically replace the above code with:<P>

<pre>
	jiGUIFramework jiGF = (jiGUIFramework)Application.application();
	WindowManager wm = jiGF.getWindowManager();
</pre>

Now that you've got your WindowManager, the simple code sequence is:<P>

<pre>
	myECExternalWindow = [create it with default size your favorite way];
	myECExternalWindow.setPositioner(wm);
	myECExternalWindow.setPositioningKey(CONSTANT_STRING_DEFINED_EARLIER);

	myECExternalWindow.setBoundsToRecommended();
</pre>

If you want to use your own positioning code in the no-saved-state case,
replace that last line with:<P>

<pre>
	Rect savedBounds = wm.savedBounds(myECExternalWindow);
	if (savedBounds != null){
	    myECExternalWindow.setBounds(savedBounds);
	} else {
	    [your own positioning code here]
	}
</pre>

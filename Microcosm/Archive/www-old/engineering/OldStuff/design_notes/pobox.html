<h2>Introduction</h2>

This design note describes a way of handing around capabilities in a
secure way. It is called a cabability PO box because it has several
similarities to a real world PO box. However, as we are already
overloaded with metaphors I'd be happy if someone can come up with
a better name.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Suppose you see an advertisement in a paper which gives a name and PO
box number. You respond to the ad, giving your name and PO box number.
Over time you build up a relationship with the owner of the PO box
(let's call them Alice) by sending mail to each other. Then, one day,
you get a letter from Alice asking for a loan. At this point you have
to decide, based on your correspondence, whether or not you trust
Alice. But one thing you don't have to worry about is whether the
request is really from Alice. You'll be sending the money to Alice's
PO box, which is your only point of contact. If someone other than
Alice is trying to scam you, all they can achieve is to give Alice an
unexpected loan. (This assumes you can trust the postal service to
deliver your money!).

<p>

The capability PO box for Microcosm works in a very similar way.  An
avatar's manifestations in the world (e.g. body, word balloons) are
all marked with the avatar's "PO box number" - actually an object
reference. This number is not presented to the user directly; instead
the avatar's chosen name is shown (more on this later). However your
session does take note of the PO box number; your address book, for
example, keeps track of people by PO box number, though it only shows
you the user visible information associated with an avatar.

<p>

When an avatar asks for a capability (e.g. the capability to send
telepathy to you), it accompanies the request with its PO box number.
You then deposit the capability in the PO box. So anyone can ask you
for a capability, but only the owner of the PO box will receive it.
Also, when you give a capability to a PO box, you ensure that it is a
"filler capability", marked with the PO box number. So any message
coming in via that capability will be marked with the PO box number;
you know that it comes from the capability you originally gave to that
PO box.

<p>

Using this system you can give out capabilities and know they are
going to the intended recipient. And when requests come in via a given
capability, you know who is responsible. Note that the usual
capability properties apply. If you give a capability to Alice she can
then pass it on to Bob. If Bob uses it, the request will come in
marked with Alice's PO box number. In this case the actual requestor
is Bob, but the responsible party is still Alice. Part of trusting
Alice with a capability is trusting that she won't give it to anyone
you don't think should have it.


<h2>Names</h2>

We don't want PO box numbers turning up in the UI because they will be
stringified object references - long, incomprehensible URLs with no
meaning for the user.  So each avatar can choose a name which will
accompany their PO box number. Furthermore you can choose your own
"pet name" for each avatar you encounter. 

<p>

So suppose you meet an avatar called Alice (i.e. Alice is the name she
has chosen for herself). You can then add your own pet name (e.g. "My
buddy Alice"). Your address book will associate both names with
Alice's PO box number. If Alice changes her name to Alicia your
address book will still be able to identify her by her PO box number
and can retrieve her old name and your pet name for her. Which name
(or combination of names) gets presented in the UI is still being
decided, but the address book will have enough information to support
several approaches.

<h2>PO Boxes and Regions</h2>

The PO box isn't just useful for direct communication between
avatars (e.g. telepathy). It's also important for communication
within a region. When you go into a region you are trusting it
to show you what is inside it. And you also trust it to manage
the conversation that goes on inside the region.

<p>

We have to trust the region. But we don't want to trust everyone
else within the region. How can we make sure that the avatars and
word ballons we see are associated with the correct people? What's
to stop Alice entering a region, claiming to be Bob? She could then
ruin Bob's reputation by saying and doing un-Boblike things.

<p>

Again the PO box provides a solution. Let's take speech as an
example. On entering the region Alice is given a facet (i.e.
capability) that allows her to participate in the region's
conversation. This facet makes sure that anything she said is marked
as "coming from Alice". This fits nicely with the PO box. Alice says
to the region "I'm Alice, I want to talk in the region, and here's my
PO box number". The region then produces a filler facet, irreversibly
marked with Alice's PO box number, and puts it into Alice's PO box. If
Alice is who she says she is, she can go to her PO box, get the
facet and thereby talk in the region.

<h2>The Postal Service and the Com System</h2>

Remember that the PO box approach only works if you can trust the
postal service. In our initial example it's no good sending the
money to Alice's PO box if the scammer can intercept the mail.

<p>

In Microcosm the Com System plays the part of the Postal Service.
And the Com System is secure. An E object reference, such as
the PO box number, has the property that no-one can pretend to
be the object referred to by that reference. Only the real object
will receive any messages sent to that reference.

<h2>Proposed Interfaces</h2>

One possible PO box interface would be:

<p><code>
    emethod giveCapability(EObject capability,
                           EDistributor receiptDistributor);
<p>
    local void getCapabilityForReceipt(CapabilityReceipt receipt,
                                       EDistributor capabilityDistributor);
</code><p>

The <code>giveCapability</code> method should be widely available -
anyone can call it. The <code>getCapabilityForReceipt</code> should
probably be a local Java method and access to it would be restricted;
only the owner of the PO box should be able to use it (the two methods
may, in fact, end up being on different objects, but conceptually
they're public and private facets of the same PO box).

<p>

So suppose an avatar wants to get into a region. Some facet of the
avatar asks some facet of the region for a conversation capability,
giving the avatar's PO box object reference as an argument. The region
then creates the conversation capability, marks it with the PO box
object reference, and calls <code>giveCapability</code> on the PO
box. In return it gets a channel to a receipt, which it gives to the
facet of the avatar. If the avatar really does own the PO box it can
get at the <code>getCapabilityForReceipt</code> method and can redeem
and use the actual capability.

<p>

This protocol involves a round trip to set up the capability. Once the
capability is in place, though, the avatar can use it to talk within
the region without any further round trips or checking.

This implies an undesirable high risk factor to people	interested on secured transactions. E offers capability-based	security concepts that allow true security. This tutorial introduces	a simple true security mechanism for exclusive-rights transfer.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><B><P>The right over <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT></P></B><P>The case described here consists on three objects, <FONT	FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT>	and <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT> (see Figure 1). <FONT	FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT> and <FONT	FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT> both send independent messages to	<FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>, but since only <FONT	FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT> has capability, exclusive rights, over	<FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>, all messages from <FONT	FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT> cannot be sent and accumulate in the	corresponding channel  (see Figure 1). The capability <FONT	FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT> has over <FONT	FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT> is actually granted by a trusted	third party object <FONT FACE="Courier">Truster1</FONT>, which gets	a message and forwards it to <FONT	FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>.</P>	<P><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></P><h2><IMG SRC="ERTFig1.gif" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="200" HSPACE="80"></h2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1. Sender1 has rights over Receiver</P><P><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></P><P>To send messages in E it is necessary to store a message in a channel	and send it via a distributor. In Figure 1, channels are represented	as funnels and distributors as triangle-shaped nozzles. So for <FONT	FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT> the message in its channel is sent	through its funnel-nozzle to <FONT FACE="Courier">Truster1</FONT>	and from there to <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>. On the other	hand, <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT> cannot send the message contained	in its channel due to the lack of rights, thus no nozzle, to send	its message.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>For details on capability-based security consult: <a	href="http://www.int-communities.com/intdocs/security-1/start.html">http://www.int-communities.com/intdocs/security-1/start.html</a>.</P><P><HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE=2></P><pre>          <a href="ERTTut2.html">Next</a>  <ahref="ERTTutI.html">Index</a>  <ahref="http://www-int.communities.com">EC internal web page</a></pre><TITLE>Exclusive Rights Transfer Tutorial</TITLE></BODY></HTML>

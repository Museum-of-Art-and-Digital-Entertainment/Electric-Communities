<H1>Bash vs 4dos</H1>

Bash and 4DOS are two shells available under DOS/Windows. Setting up
the build environment installs them both and puts links to them in your
Programs menu.
<P>
Both Bash and 4DOS have useful features - filename completion, command
history available via the arrow keys, output redirection and piping,
aliases and cdpaths.
<P>
Bash is more Unix like and does a nicer job with pipes (when you pipe
output in Bash the output goes to the other program as the output is
generated; in 4DOS it's only sent to the other program once the first
program is finished). But Bash has the disadvantage that you can't use
it to run ".bat" files (unless they're really simple ones with no
arguments or variable substitutions, in which case you can do "source
whatever.bat").
<P>
So I tend to use Bash for building and as a general purpose shell. But
I keep 4DOS around for when I want to run Microcosm, because the
Microcosm "run.bat" startup file is a bat file.

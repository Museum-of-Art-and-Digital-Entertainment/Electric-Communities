<p>
We all know that it is very important not to break the build. We have
over 20 developers at the company. When the build breaks many of them
will waste time trying to figure out what happened. A single, simple,
build break can cost a person day of effort. Serious build breaks can
cost far more.
<p>
The other side of the coin is that our build environment is slow and
(even after much heroic work by Eric and Felix) hard to use. Our
application is also slow and hard to test. We are working to improve
this but it's not going to improve overnight. The consequence of a
slow system that's hard to test is that it is much harder and more
tedious than it should be to test something and check it in with
confidence. Because of this, many extremely smart and diligent people,
working with the best of intentions, have been guilty of breaking the
build. Even so, we can't use this as an excuse. We have to avoid build
breaks.
<p>
This page gives some guidelines on the tests you should do before
checking something in. Not all the tests are necessary all the time,
there is room for using your good judgement. If all you've changed is
the string in a trace message you don't need to do a full rebuild
followed by a client server test. But you should, of course, at least
compile the file before checking in.


<h2>Guidelines For Testing HabiFoo Before Checkin</h2>

If you've made significant changes to the HabiFoo application you
should do the following before checking in.

<p>
<ul>
<li> Rebuild from scratch (delete all your class and unit files and
rebuild the entire source tree). This is harder than you might
think. Make sure you read
<a href="FAQ.html#ScratchBuild">How do I rebuild from scratch?</a>
for details.

<li> Bring up HabiFoo and test the code you changed. Seems obvious, I
know, but people have checked in without doing this.

<li> Run through as much of the
<a href="#SmokeTest">developer smoke test</a>
as you think is necessary. Ideally you'd do the full smoke test
every time, but given the speed of our system it may be appropriate
to take shortcuts. The important thing to know is that if the smoke test
doesn't work the build is considered to be broken.

<li> If you've added any new files to the source directory make sure
you <code>cvs add</code> them before you commit. Go to the root of the
tree and type <code>cvs -nq update -d</code>. This gives a summary of
everything you have changed (the lines that start with M), without
changing anything. Look carefully at all the lines that start with ?;
these are files that are not under CVS control. Many of them will be
junk (temporary logs etc.) but there may be source files you've
forgotten to <code>cvs add</code>.

<li> It's often useful to go to the root of the tree, type <code>cvs
diff >& cvsdiff.log</code> and then check through the resulting
log. This gives you an overview of what you've changed (it also gives
you information about files not under cvs control, so if you do it you
don't need to do <code>cvs -nq update -d</code> as well). It's
particularly valuable after doing a merge, when you want to be sure
you didn't lose anything while merging.

<li>When you checkin, use <code>cvs commit</code> from the root of the
source tree. If everyone does this it prevents overlapping checkins
that together break the system. <code>cvs commit</code> locks the tree
temporarily and will only let you check in if there are no modified
files in the entire tree. Anyone trying to do an overlapping checkin
will have to wait until you're done - and will then need to deal with
your changes.

</ul>

<p>
If you're unlucky, by the time you've finished this cycle someone else
may have checked in further changes to the tree. If this happens you
need to check out the entire tree again, merge any conflicts and then
repeat the build and test cycle. This is a real pain, I know, but
source control systems aren't just being annoying when they won't let
you commit until you've got the latest changes. You're
<em>supposed</em> to get the latest changes, do any merging and then
re-test, because otherwise you're checking in an untested system. This
is preaching to the converted for most people, but again we have had
cases where people haven't done this and the build has broken because
of it.


<h2>Additional Guidelines For Changes In The ec3 Tree</h2>

If you make changes in the ec3 tree life is harder still. We try to
allow people who only work on HabiFoo to just recompile the src\cosm1
tree. They get everything in the ec3 tree prebuilt, via the build
environment. A new build environment is built every night and is
released early in the morning (unless there are errors).
<p>
So ideally, if you work in the ec3 tree, you should ensure that
everything always builds for everyone.  This is usually, though
perhaps not always, feasible, with a little work. If you really can't
manage it and you need to check in changes to the src\cosm1 tree that
won't work without your changes to the ec3 tree then you should:
<ul>
<li>Checkin your changes as late as possible in the day, preferably
after 10pm
<li>Clearly mark your checkin message so that people will know that
they need the new environment before they can build your changes.
</ul>
Even with these precautions there may be problems - if the nightly
build fails the build environment won't be fully updated. Then people
may check out your src\cosm1 changes and get hosed.
<p>
One further alternative, to be used in rare cases, is to checkin a set
of changes in ec3 and src\cosm1 and then ask everyone else to rebuild
the entire world. The new build environment does make it easier for
people to rebuild the entire world, not just the HabiFoo sources in
\src\cosm1. But building the world takes a long time (over 2 hours on
some people's machines) and requires you to have Visual C++ installed,
so not everyone does it routinely. The bottom line is that if you make
a checkin that requires a rebuild of the world you are probably
slowing down several other people's development cycle by asking them
to do a lengthly build. It still may be the right the to do. But if
you want to do it, please consult with Gordie, RobJ or Trev before
going ahead, and make sure you give everyone clear notice of what
you're doing.

<h4>How To Change ec3 Without Breaking \src\cosm1</h4>

So, if you can, avoid checkins to src\cosm1 that rely on changes in
ec3 which are not yet part of the build environment. This is extra
work, but is possible. John has done a lot of work on the Support
directory in the ec3 tree. Here's his routine for making changes to
Support without breaking \src\cosm1.
<p>
Suppose you've got changes to Support and corresponding
changes to cosm:
<ul>
<li>Verify that the currently checked-in cosm
sources will compile (and not do anything particulary terrible when
running) with your changes to Support. The most straightforward way
to do this, of course, is to do all your work in Support and check it
in before you do any work in src\cosm1.
<li> If you did have to make changes in src\cosm1, temporarily remove
your src\cosm1 changes so you can rebuild and verify you didn't break
anything. Then check in your changes to Support, and wait for the next
updated build environment (usually the next day).
<li> Check in your changes to src\cosm1.
</ul>
Sometimes this approach requires two passes in Support -- in the first
pass, you add API but don't remove anything that's currently
called. Then after the next build environment update, you go through
src\cosm1 fixing all the callers to stop using the old calls. Then in the
second Support pass, you remove the old calls.


<h2>Additional Guidelines For Changes Affecting The Repository</h2>

If you touch the repository, the openers/serialization code or any one
of the classes stored in the Repository (notably Appearance2D and
Appearance3D) you must build a new repository with your changes in
place, in addition to the normal build and test. The test should be
done with the new repository you built. In many cases the easiest
thing to do may be to <A href="BuildRelease.html">build a full
release</a>.  It takes a long time, but it does rebuild
<em>everything</em>, including the repository.
<p>
If you make changes that require a new repository you must build a new
repository and put it in <code>\home\eng\media</code> under a name
like <code>Repository.new</code>. Then, when you checkin, let people
know they need the new repository (and where to find it!). If you make
linked changes to the serialization code in ec3 and the repository,
follow the guidelines for checking into ec3, in addition to the
repository guidelines.
<p>
Repository changes have proved particularly tricky in the past, so
take special care to follow the guidelines.


<h2>Some Shortcuts When Building And Testing</H2>

The full rebuild and test cycles described above are very
slow. Sometimes it will be sensible to make shortcuts. Here's some
suggestions for ways to speed up testing. Use them with care!

<ul>
<li> If you don't change any interfaces, or you're absolutely sure you've
found and updated every place that uses an interface you've changed,
you can avoid the full build. Once we all have faster machines,
though, it's probably safer to just do the full build anyway.

<li> If you only change things in the gui code of HabiFoo, and don't
touch any presenter interfaces, you should be able to just rebuild the
gui area; the unum part of HabiFoo should be completely insulated by
the presenter interfaces. If the gui code you changed is all crew you
can probably omit the revival test. You may be able to omit the
client/server test if your code has nothing to do with connections
between HabiFoos. (But note that if you DO change something in the
presenter layer it is very important for you to do a full build and
revival test).

<li> If you only change things in the unum part of HabiFoo you probably
don't need to rebuild the presenter and gui and console layers.  But you
probably do need to do the client/server and revival tests.

<li> When you've done a build and test cycle but then find you need to
merge in new changes you can probably avoid a full build if the new
changes are on the other side of the presenter layer (e.g. you've been
changing gui code and the new changes are in unum land).

</ul>

<h2>Checkin Freeze Procedure</h2>

Occasionally, for really world shattering changes (or for snapshotting
a release), it is necessary to have a <em>checkin freeze</em>. A
checkin freeze is when everyone except you agrees to leave the tree
alone until you have done what you want to do (make your checkin, take
a snapshot etc.).
<p>
Clearly a checkin freeze is not to be done lightly. If you need to do
one, here's the procedure:
<ul>

<li>Send out mail several hours beforehand announcing the freeze and
asking if anyone has objections.

<li>Send out mail an hour beforehand giving a reminder that the freeze is
coming.

<li>Go round offices checking in with people to make sure they know about
the freeze, and seeing if there are any last minute checkins on the way.

<li>At the freeze deadline, wait about 15-30 minutes for trailing checkins
(somebody will probably try to get something in at the last minute).

<li>Now you're frozen. Do whatever you need to do as quickly as possible.

<li>When you're done, send out mail lifting the freeze.
</ul>


<a name="SmokeTest">
<h2>Developer Smoke Test</h2>
</a>

The purpose of the developer smoke test is to check that no really
blatant run time errors have got into the build. The QA team do a much
more thorough smoke test when they test a release, but that test is
too long to ask developers to use before every checkin. This test is an
attempt to hit the most important areas with a test that is short
enough that people will actually use it.
<p>
Even the smoke test given below can take a long time, given the speed
of our system. You can choose to skip parts of it if you are 100%
confident that your change doesn't affect that part of the system -
but remember that if the smoke test doesn't run the build is broken.
<p>
You may find it useful to team up with your build buddy to do the
smoke test; running two copies of HabiFoo on a single machine can lead
to massive thrashing. For details of how to run HabiFoo, see <a
href="RunHabiFoo.html">Running The HabiFoo Application</a>. Note
that, of course, you should also do specific testing of any feature
area directly affected by your changes.
<p>
First stage of the test, just one HabiFoo. Let's say the avatar is called
Alice (Alice should start up in a realm with both 2D and 3D regions, e.g.
BeachTown):
<ul>
<li>Walk around
<li>Type word balloon
<li>Send telepathy to self
<li>Transition to 2D region (e.g. Lighthouse, or outside of Trailer Turf)
<li>Transition to 3D region (e.g. Beach, or inside of Trailer Turf)
</ul>

Second stage of test; start up a second HabiFoo and connect to Alice's
HabiFoo. Say the new avatar is called Bob:
<ul>
<li>Move Bob to same region as Alice
<li>Type word balloons
<li>Send telepathy from Alice to Bob and vice versa
<li>Add Alice to Bob's address book
<li>Move Bob to different region in Alice's realm
<li>Send telepathy again
<li>Move Alice to same region as Bob
<li>Use Bob's catalog to create object
<li>Have Bob put the object down then pick it up again
<li>Put Bob's object in Bob's pocket
<li>Quit Bob's session, then revive it and re-join Alice (you can
use the "Recent" section in the teleport list to get to Alice's
region)
<li>Test word balloons and telepathy again
<li>Check object is still in Bob's pocket, get it out and put it down
<li>Have Alice pick up the object, move it into another region and put it down
<li>Check Alice is still in Bob's address book
</ul>

This smoke test is a first attempt, not the final word. Let me
(<A HREF="mailto:trev@communities.com">Trev</A>) know if you
think it needs to be made larger, smaller or changed in any
way.

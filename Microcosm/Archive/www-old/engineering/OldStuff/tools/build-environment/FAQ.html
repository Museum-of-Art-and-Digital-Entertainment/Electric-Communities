<h2><a name="C:Drive">How do I build on places other than the C: drive?</a></h2>
Thanks to Sidney for this description
<p>
There are five directories that are on C drive by default and may be
installed elsewhere. You indicate deviations from the default by setting
environment variables. In Windows 95 you set them in c:\autoexec.bat and in
NT you use the System Control Panel, in the Environment tab.
<p>
You will also need to use the <code>mount</code>
command. <code>mount</code> is a command that tells bash (and the
other GNU tools - make etc.) where to find
directories. e.g. <code>mount e:\ec /EC</code> means that wherever a
GNU tool sees the pathname <code>/EC/<em>somepath</em></code> it will
look for <em>somepath</em> under
<code>e:\ec</code>. <code>mount</code> stores away its mount points in
a file, so they persist across reboots. You have to use
<code>umount</code> to get rid of a mount point.
<p>
Note that <code>mount</code> is part of the build environment. If you're
installing from scratch you'll need to first set all the environment
variables, then check out the build environment and finally do the
<code>mount</code> commands. The <code>mount</code> commands quoted below
work in a 4DOS or 4NT shell. To use them in a Bash shell, you'll have to
add a second backslash in front of any listed backslash, since backslash
is a unix quote character.
<p>
The VC++ compiler version 4 is by default in c:\msdev and version 5 is in
"c:\Program Files\DevStudio". You'll need to set environment variables to
indicate where you have it installed
(see <a href="#MSDEV">here</a> for full details), e.g:

<blockquote>
       set MSDEVDRIVE=E:
<br>
       set MSDEV=Program Files\DevStudio
<br>
       set VC_VERSION=5.0 <em>(only if you use 5.0)</em>
</blockquote>

The other directories are listed below along with their default value and
the environment variables you need to set and the mount command you need to
issue once if you place them on a different drive. You don't really get to
change the directory name, just the drive. In the table below I show what
you would do if that directory is put on the E drive.
<p>
\EC defaults to C drive
<blockquote>
    set ECROOTDRIVE=E:
<br>
    mount e:\ec /EC
</blockquote>
<p>
\src drive defaults to same as \EC
<blockquote>
    set SRC=e:/src
<br>
    mount e:\src /src
</blockquote>
<p>
\Media defaults to same as \EC
<blockquote>
    set MEDIADIR=e:/media
<br>
    mount e:\media /media
</blockquote>
<p>
\Build defaults to same as \EC
<blockquote>
    set BUILD_DRIVE=E:
<br>
    mount e:\build /build
</blockquote>
<p>
You need to mount /bin so that tools can find the shell in /bin/sh and
/Program Files so they can find Visual C++:
<blockquote>
    mount e:\bin /bin
<br>
    mount "e:\Program Files" "/Program Files"
</blockquote>
You'll also need a /tmp directory set up; if you want that on your E: drive
too then you'll need to mount it in the same way.
<p>
Note that if everything is built on the E drive, set ECROOTDRIVE=E: and the
mount commands will take care of all the directories; you don't need to
set all the individual environment variables.
<p>
Also note the unfortunate inconsistencies in whether to specify a full path
or just a drive letter in the environment variable and the use of forward
slashes in the environment variables rather than backslashes.
<p>


<h2><a name="PluribusLoop">What do I do if the Pluribus compiler seems to be in an infinite loop?</a></h2>

Thanks to Karl for this description
<p>
Any time you spend more than 20 seconds waiting for a pl command
to finish, you're stuck in a loop.
<p>
While there may be a few of these lurking in the "while (ptr)" loops
deep in the guts of the compiler, it is *much* more likely that
hackdepends is choking on some stderr output (the compiler is trying
to spit out a message to stderr, but hackdepends - which forked the
compiler - is blocking it), so
<p>
<ol>

<li> Break out of the make (which may cause duplicate class problems;
  delete the appropriate .class.list file--See the mail message
  "PLEASE READ FOR DUPLICATE CLASS PROBLEMS ON PCS").
<li> Type "set HACK_DEPENDS=false" at the window prompt (this capitalization/
  lowercase format works on 4DOS.  It may not be necessary, but I know it
  works; NT is another matter :-).
<li> Go to the directory where the original make blew up and run make there, or
  as close as you can get to it--Running make from the top with hackdepends
  off can take a looong time.
<li> Fix the Pluribus error(s) which caused the problem in the first place.
<li> Run make again just to make (ahem) sure.
<li> Repeat 4 and 5 until there's no error.
<li> Type "set HACK_DEPENDS=true".
<li> Return to your regularly scheduled make.
<li> Call Felix if there's still a problem.
<li> Call Rob if there's still a problem.
</ol>

<p>



<h2><a name="JavaLoop">What do I do if the Java compiler seems to be in an infinite loop?</a></h2>

This is actually the same problem as <a href="#PluribusLoop">What do I
do if the Pluribus compiler seems to be in an infinite loop?</a>. You
can even fix it the same way.



<h2><a name="PluribusBuild">How can I build a Pluribus compiler and runtime?</a></h2>
Thanks to Karl for this description
<p>
On the off chance someone needs to make a Pluribus run time and compiler
and I'm not around, here are some easy steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Make the run time: If it needs it (i.e., something's changed).
<li> Make the compiler: See above comment.
<li> Run "~karl/bin/install-new-pluribus <version name of release>:
This will copy stuff from your $BUILD tree into:
<blockquote>
    /home/eng/internal-releases/pluribus/<version name of release>
</blockquote>
You must chooses a name that has not been used there yet.
<li> Make a win32 directory:
<blockquote>
    mkdir /home/eng/internal-releases/pluribus/<version name of release>/win32
</blockquote>
<li> Remake the run time and compiler on a PC:
Or copy an old one if nothing changed.  Move the PC bin directory
   and the PC lib directory (well, only the plrun files really) into the
   win32 dir from #4.
<li> Set protections:
   The install-new-pluribus sets most of them for you, but you'll have
   to do the win32 files by hand.
<blockquote>
    cd /home/eng/internal-releases/pluribus/<version name of release>
<br>
    chmod -R 755 win32
</blockquote>
<li> Fix dirs on anaxagoras:
   Log into anaxagoars.  Switch to superuser (or Danfuzz :-).  Go to
   /home/eng.  Remove the pl-whatever you're getting rid of:
<blockquote>
    rm pl-whatever
</blockquote>
Do NOT put a trailing '/' on this or it won't work.  Now make a link
   to the stuff you installed:
<blockquote>
      ln -s internal-releases/pluribus/version-name-of-release pl-whatever
</blockquote>
<li> Have a beer
<li> Go home before anyone asks you to make another one.
</ol>


<h2><a name="JavaVMBuild">How can I build a Java VM?</a></h2>
Thanks to Felix for this description
<p>
The magic is quite simple -- the only problem is that one must have
VC42, MKS toolkit, and MASM installed in order to make the magic
work. These are available in <code>\\Talisman</code> (in the Ec net
group) so people can copy this stuff and avoid the installation
tribulations (i.e. MASM comes on several floppies) that I had to go
through.
<p>
If VC42 is installed in c:\msdev42, MKS toolkit is in c:\MKSDemo, and MASM
is in c:\MASM, all one needs to do to build the VM is follow these steps:
<p>
<ul>
<li>run src-external/java-1.1.3/ec-setup.bat
<li>cd to src-external/java-1.1.3/build/win32
<li>nmake
<li>nmake debug
</ul>
The results of the build will end up in the bin, lib, and classes
subdirectories
of src-external/java-1.1.3/build/win32.  The stuff in the bin and lib
subdirectories can be copied verbatim, but the stuff in the classes
subdirectory needs to be zipped into a classes.zip file.  This can be done
with winzip or with /home/eng/unix/bin/zip on solaris.  Do NOT use zip.exe
for windows, because it doesn't store directory info in the zipfile, and
then import java.blah.* won't work.
<p>
I usually take the solaris route since the distribution is supposed to end
up in /home/eng/java-ecdbg* anyway.  Here's what I do:
<p>
<blockquote>
C:\>mkdir u:\felix\classes
<br>
C:\>xcopy /s c:\src-external\java-1.1.3\build\win32\classes u:\felix\classes
<br>
harpo//home/felix/classes=>zip -r0 classes.zip .
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="Hackdepends">What is hackdepends?</a></h2>

Hackdepends is a Java program written by RobJ. The windows
GNUmakefiles use it to do a lot of stuff that was being done by
multiple GNU commands executed via shell scripts. The shell script
approach was horribly slow on Win95/NT so RobJ wrote hackdepends so
that all this stuff could be done by a single process. It speeded up
compilation <b>a lot</b>. So hackdepends is your friend (except very
occasionally - see
<a href="#PluribusLoop">What do I do if the Pluribus compiler seems to be in an infinite loop?</a>). If you don't want it to be your friend you can
disable it by typing <code>set HACK_DEPENDS=false</code> at a 4dos prompt
and then running make again from that 4dos.
<p>



<h2><a name="Talisman">When I try to start 4dos or Bash I get a popup asking me for a password for Talisman. What's going on?</a></h2>
You're on NT right? If not let me know. This seems to be a weird NT only
problem that started with the new build environment. Talisman is the machine
the shortcuts were built on and its name is embedded in the shortcut files
that are copied into your program menu.
<p>
Felix has recently checked in new versions of the shorcuts which don't
have this problem (so you can get the latest build environment - cvs update
in \EC - then do UpdateIcons again). Alternatively, the workaround is to edit
the shortcuts manually (joy!). You can do this as follows (thanks to Bob for
this description):

<ul>
<li>Bring up the file browser on your program menu directory
(<code>C:\winnt\Profiles\All Users\Start Menu\Programs</code>)
<li>Click on the shortcut you want to change e.g. <code>4dos
(Build)</code> with the right mouse button and click on Properties in
the resulting menu
<li>When the property sheet comes up click on the Shortcut tab and cut
(CTRL-X) the contents of the "Target" field. (One special case; for
the Bash icon you should cut all but the last argument).
<li>Hit the 'Apply' button (this sets the target to nothing, and should
get rid of the problematic hidden reference to Talisman).
<li>Paste (CTRL-V) in the contents of the Target field.
<li>Hit OK
</ul>



<h2><a name="BuildRelease">What's the difference between 4dos (Build) and 4dos (Release)?</a></h2>

4dos (Build) sets up the environment so that classes and libraries are
first looked up in \Build\steward,crew etc and then looked up in the
standard environment. This means that things built locally come first,
which is what most developers want. It's the shell most people should
use for building and testing. 4dos (Release) is used when building a
release from scratch with as little environment set up as
possible. Most people will not need it unless they are in the business
of creating releases or are deep in the E runtime.



<h2><a name="rm">rm -rf is telling me I have a circularity and is
refusing to delete something. What's going on?</a></h2> It's
lying. The GNU version of rm makes up occasional circularities, just
to annoy you. Try using the native Windows/NT equivalents. They're
quicker and more reliable. On Win95 <code>deltree /y
directoryname</code>. On NT <code>rd /sq directoryname</code>. Even
these don't always work; <code>deltree</code> fails silently if a file
is in use and <code>rd</code> fails noisily. So double check that the
directory is really gone. Perhaps best of all is to use the
explorer/file browser. Select the directory in the explorer GUI and
then hit SHIFT-DELETE to delete it right away, without putting it in
the recycle bin. This technique reliably gives you an error message if
it fails, and you can see right away if it succeeded.


<h2><a name="StartPLS">How do I start a PLS?</a></h2>
Thanks to Eric for this description. This was written on 12/17/97.<p>

<P><B>$ cd cvs/src</B>

<P><B>$ cvs update -d</B>
<BR>to make sure I've got all the latest stuff.

<P><B>$ rm -rf $BUILD</B>
<BR>so I get a clean build.&nbsp; You might need to do a blah-none or something
as well.

<P><B>$ gnumake ecomp eruntime</B>
<BR>Build the stuff to be used by the new PLS.&nbsp; If e-stable has an
up to date ecomp, building it is probably supurfluous, but it's nice to
be safe anyway...

<P>Ok, the build looks good, so it's time to copy it into /home/eng/pls-location

<P><B>$ mkdir /home/eng/pls-location/Release.1997.12.16</B>
<BR>Make a directory to put the classes in.&nbsp; Make sure you use today's
date :-)&nbsp; As long as this PLS is running, it will be getting its classes
from this directory.&nbsp; Once this PLS is retired, the contents of the
Release... directory can be moved into /home/eng/pls-location/old/...

<P><B>$ cd $BUILD</B>

<P><B>$ cp -r bin/ classes/ compute/ crew/ guest/ lib/ steward/ /home/eng/pls-location/Release.1997.12.16</B>
<BR>Copy the necessary components of the build into its stable location.

<P><B>$ rm Release</B><B></B>

<P><B>$ ln -s Release.1997.12.16 Release</B>
<BR>Release is a symlink to the latest release.&nbsp; The init code (see
below) will use this link to find pls_restart later.

<P>We're going to start this PLS on george.communities.com at port 1668,
so we open a window on george at this point.

<P><B>george$ cd /home/eng/pls-location</B>

<P><B>george$ ln -s Release.1997.12.16 george.communities.com_1668.Release</B>
<BR>This tells the PLS where it's particular classes are supposed to come
from.&nbsp; This way, we can have several different PLS's running with
the same classes, and several different sets of classes being used by different
PLS's.&nbsp; pls_initial will complain if you don't do this link.

<P><B>george$ su</B>
<BR>Since we want this PLS to be restarted whenever it fails, and on any
reboot, it will need to be run as root.&nbsp; /home/eng/pls-location is
on alaxandria, so root accesses end up as accesses by user 'nobody'.&nbsp;
We want to create all the files with appropriate permissions to be accessed
this way, so we might as well start early.&nbsp; You man need to adjust
your path to include /home/eng/pls-location/Release/bin so you can find
pls_initial and friends.

<P><B>george# pls_initial 1668</B>
<BR>This creates an initial checkpoint file (among other things).&nbsp;
It also reminds you to do the following ftp steps to make the PLS accessable
to people that can't get to /home/eng via a shared filesystem.

<P><B>george# ftp www.communities.com</B>
<BR><B>Name (www.communities.com:eric): &lt;Return></B>
<BR><B>331 Password required for eric.</B>
<BR><B>Password: &lt;*******></B>
<BR><B>ftp> cd /var/ftp/pub/pls-location</B>
<BR><B>ftp> put george.communities.com_1668</B>
<BR><B>ftp> &lt;^D></B>

<P><B>george# &lt;insert favorite editor here> /etc/inittab</B><B></B>

<P>Add the following two lines at the end:
<BR><B>ps:234:respawn:/home/eng/pls-location/Release/bin/pls_restart -fg
1668 >>/tmp/pls_restart.log 2>&amp;1</B>
<BR><B>pl:234:respawn:/home/eng/pls-location/Release/bin/pls_killifhung
1668 >>/tmp/pls_kill.log 2>&amp;1</B>
<BR>^^ this pair of letters has to be unique in the file, change at will.
Make sure you get the correct port number in the command.

<P><B>george# kill -1 1</B>
<BR>This tells init (process 1) to reread /etc/inittab and start any processes
it needs to as a result.&nbsp; It runs pls_restart which restarts the PLS.&nbsp;
You can now watch the log by doing:

<P><B>george# tail -f george.communities.com_1668.log</B>

<P>If you are starting PLS's for more than one server, you can just do
the host specific parts over again for the other hosts (like gracie and
harpo, for example).

<P>If you want to update a PLS in place which has been placed in inittab,
first you should disable its entry in inittab by changing both of the :respawn:
entries to :off:.&nbsp; kill -1 1 to get this to take effect, then you
can update the pls files.&nbsp; When you're ready to restart it, change
the :off: entries back to :respawn:, and kill -1 1 again.
<p>



<h2><a name="RunPLS">How can I run a test PLS?</a></h2>
Thanks to Eric for this description. Note that this for Unix only.
<p>
<code>src/ec3/E/runtime/e/net/pls/pls_test</code>
is a script for running a test PLS.  Just run it in a scratch
directory and give it an unused port as it's argument.  It will spit
out the RegisterWith and SearchPath arguments you need to use.  The
log file is tailed, and when you hit ^C the PLS is killed.
<p>
You must have an eruntime build in $BUILD.
<p>
pls_test is installed in $BUILD/bin, which should be on your $PATH, so
you can just say:
<p>
<blockquote>
mkdir ferd
<br>
cd ferd
<br>
pls_test 9876
</blockquote>



<h2><a name="CVSAll">How can I update all my CVS directories at once</a></h2>
Thanks to Sidney for this description.
<p>
If you want to update all the cvs trees on your machine in one fell swoop
you can go to your root directory and type:
<blockquote>
  cvs update -d EC media src
</blockquote>
Or, what I usually do to eliminate the no-op messages:
<blockquote>
  cvs -q update -d EC media src
</blockquote>



<h2><a name="MSDEV">Why isn't make finding cl or anything from Microsoft Developer Studio?</a></h2>

First, make sure you have Microsoft Developer Studio installed. You
should install version 5.0 and use at least the "Typical"
installation, so you get the MFC classes (we use some of the MFC
window handle stuff). If you don't use the "Typical" installation
you'll get complaints about not having all the DLLs you need. You can
find the Microsoft Developer Studio C++ 5.0 CD in Felix's office, or
you can install it from the net at <code>\\cassandra\visualc5</code>.
The CD key is 806-5644646.
<p>
If you've installed Studio but still get errors you may need to tweak
some environment variables which tell the build environment where to
find it.  By default the (Build) shells look for Studio in
<code>C:\MSDev</code>, which is the place Studio version 4.0 was
usually installed. This is probably the wrong default, as we're
standardizing on Studio 5.0. But we're not changing it until we're
sure everyone has upgraded from 4.0.
<p>
So, if you're using a (Build) shell, you should edit your autoexec.bat
(Win95) or use the Control Panel\System environment panel (NT), to set
the following environment variables
<blockquote>
  set MSDEVDRIVE=C: <em>(set this to the drive on which you installed Studio)</em>
<br>
  set MSDEV=Program Files\DevStudio <em>(assuming you installed in the standard directory)</em>
<br>
  set VC_VERSION=5.0 <em>(this will not be necessary once everyone uses 5.0)</em>
</blockquote>
</ul>
Note that there are no quotes and no leading or trailing "\" characters
in the MSDEV variable. On Win95 you'll need to reboot before the
variables take effect. On NT you can just restart your 4dos/Bash
shell.
<p>
If you build a full release (see <a href="BuildRelease.html">Building
a Release</a>) setting the environment variables isn't enough. When
building a release you run the <code>config.build</code> script, with
a configuration file as its argument, to set up your environment
before building. <code>config.build</code> does <em>not</em> look at
the environment variables you have set, instead it uses the ones in
the configuration file. So when you run <code>config.build</code> you
must check that the configuration file matches your Studio
installation. The default configuration file,
<code>release.config</code>, assumes Studio Version 5.0, installed in
the standard place on the C: drive i.e.  <code>MSDEVDRIVE=c:</code>
and <code>MSDEV="Program Files/DevStudio"</code>. 
<p>
So, if you installed Studio some place other than C:\Program
Files\DevStudio you'll need a custom configuration file:
<ul>
<li>Change directory to <code>\src</code>
<li>Make a copy of <code>release.config</code>, say <code>myconfigfile</code>
<li>Edit the MSDEV and MSDEVDRIVE lines in <code>myconfigfile</code>
<li>Run <code>config.build myconfigfile <em>command</em></code>
</ul>



<h2><a name="ScratchBuild">How do I rebuild from scratch?</a></h2>

First you must delete everything you've built so far. Unfortunately
<code>make clean</code> doesn't reliably clean out everything because
of problems with <a href="#rm">rm</a>. To be safe, it's best to
manually delete all the class files and object files (i.e. use
SHIFT-DELETE in the file browser - the most reliable technique - or
<code>deltree /y \Build</code> on Windows95, <code>rd /qs
\Build</code> on WinNT). When you've done this make sure that
<code>\Build</code> is really gone. Both <code>deltree</code>
and <code>rd</code> fail if files in the directory are in use, and
<code>deltree</code> has the nasty habit of failing silently.
<p>
Once <code>\Build</code> is gone, move <code>\EC\FP</code> or
<code>\EC\FP\cosm</code> out of the way and recompile. Moving
<code>\EC\FP</code> is important or you'll miss some build
ordering errors. If you're using a 4dos or Bash (Build) shell, as most
people do, the environment puts various subdirectories of
<code>\EC\FP</code> on your <code>PATH</code> and
<code>CLASSPATH</code>, which means you your compilation can find
pre-built classes and libraries in <code>\EC\FP</code>. So, for
example, suppose you change class A so that it now depends on class B,
which is built later in the build process. This is a build breaker,
because class B won't be there when A is compiled. But you may not
spot it because your (Build) shell can pick up the old class B from
<code>\EC\FP</code>.
<p>
So what does this mean for you? People who just build HabiFoo can
temporarily move <code>\EC\FP\cosm</code> out of the way before doing
<code>make cosm</code>. That way you can be sure you're not picking
up any old cosm classes, but you don't have to build the full
tree. If you do this, remember to put <code>\EC\FP\cosm</code> back
before you do a <code>make release</code> or check out
<code>\EC</code> again! Note that you will have to do a
<code>make release</code> because you deleted everything in
<code>\Build</code>.
<p>
People who build the whole tree can move all of <code>\EC\FP</code>
out of the way before doing <code>make everything</code> (again,
remember to put it back before checking out <code>\EC</code> or doing
your <code>make release</code>!). There is a (somewhat unreliable)
script for doing this - see
<a href="BuildTools.html#cleanbuild">cleanbuild.sh</a>.
Alternatively, if you have time, you
can try building a release. See <A href="BuildRelease.html">Building a
Release</a> for more details.  The release shell doesn't set up nearly
as much environment so it won't pick up anything from
<code>\EC\FP</code>.
<p>


<h2><a name="Cafe">How do I build in Cafe?</a></h2>

Thanks to Jay for these instructions
<p>
To make things work OK with multi-drive systems I added an environment
variable that tells my scripts which drive Cafe is installed on.
CAFEHOME should be set to C: D: or whatever.
<p>
Change to the EC\cafe directory and type:
<blockquote>
  setupcafe
</blockquote>
This will copy the Cafe project over into the release directory.
<p>
You can then start Cafe up using the StartMenu 4DOS(Cafe) command --the
project that is checked in now only uses the file CafeSucks.java.
<p>
To run the script that converts our E into Java enter: <code>foo2jall</code>.
This will convert the E run time and all the Pluribus objects.
(This is really slow--to do things selectively use the scripts defined below.)
It will put the objects into several directories - in particular you only have
to bring in the e runtime if desired, or just some of the pluribus stuff.
<p>
<code>foo2j</code> - Works the way it always has. It converts the
first file, storing the result in the second if given, otherwise it
stores into the default generated code directory.

<code>f2jall <em>extension</em> <em>target-place</em></code> -
Converts all files with the given extension in the current directory
and all child directories and puts the result into the target place.
e.g. <code>f2jall e c:\build\gencode\cafegen\avatarstuff</code>
<p>
<code>f2jdir <em>extension</em> <em>target-place</em></code> - Works
like above but only converts the files in the current directory. The
following example uses a wild card: <code>f2jdir *
c:\build\gencode\cafegen\eruntime</code>
<p>
<code>f2jzap.bat</code> -  this command deletes all the files that
<code>foo2jall.bat</code>  made
that have been determined to be irrelevant.  I use this command so I can
add all the files in a directory without having to remember the names of
the bozo files.
<p>
I changed the scripts to no longer use CafeSucks.java (except in one
place). This means that you will get piles of warnings the first time you
compile something. They can be ignored.


<h2><a name="Future">Make is telling me "Build error: make: *** File `<em>somefile</em>' has modification time in the future"; what should I do?</a></h2>

This error normally happens shortly after a cvs update, and is usually due
to clock skew between the cvs file server and your local machine. For many
files the messages are harmless and the build will continue correctly. But
there are a few places where this message actually kills the build e.g.
when building the Pluribus compiler.
<p>
You can minimize this problem by setting the clock on your local machine
to be the same as the clock on the cvs server, rashomon (rlogin to
rashomon and type <code>date</code>).

<h2>Before You Start</h2>

Here's a list of things you must have before you start on setting up the
build environment itself:
<ul>

<li>You must have accounts on EC's unix machines (groucho, harpo, rashomon,
etc) or you won't be able to use cvs. Talk to Rob Kinninmont (blessed be
his name) if you don't have an account.

<li> If you plan to build or modify any native code you should install
Microsoft Developer Studio C++ 5.0 (Stored in Felix's office, or
available on the net in <code>\\cassandra\visualc5</code>). Note that
you'll need to build native code if you plan to build in the ec3
source tree or build complete releases. See the <a
href="FAQ.html#MSDEV">FAQ</a> for more on setting up studio

<li>Install DirectX by double-clicking on the following file:
<A HREF="file:///\\alexandria/eng/win32/DirectX/DirectX.EXE">\\alexandria\eng\win32\DirectX\DirectX.EXE</A>

<LI>Install WinZip by clicking on the following file:
<A HREF="file:///\\alexandria/public/windows/WinZip.exe">\\alexandria\public\windows\WinZip.exe</A>

<li>If you want access to Unix from your Windows box, install CRT (our
standard Windows terminal program) by running
<A HREF="file:///\\alexandria/public/windows/Telnet_CRT20.exe">\\alexandria\public\windows\Telnet_CRT20.exe</A>
<p>
Here is the registration information for CRT, which you can cut and paste from this document.
<blockquote>
  Name: 25 User Right To Use License
<br>
  Company: Electric Communities
<br>
  Serial Number: 01-11-100115
<br>
  Expiration: Never
<br>
  xKey: p29m vb29 uai0 vn73 8crv uvj2 ehuu 74hm
</blockquote>

<li> If you've never used CVS before you should probably look at the docs on
<A HREF="../cvsdoc/index.html">the CVS page</A>.

</ul>

<h2>Setting Up The Build Environment</h2>

<ul>

<li>Warning: if you are building on a drive other than your C: drive
you'll need some special environment variables and mounts. See the <a
href="FAQ.html#C:Drive">FAQ</a>, before setting the standard variables
described below. On Windows 95 you have to reboot for changes in
Autoexec.bat to take effect, so make sure you make all the changes you
need before rebooting.

<li>
If you are a Windows 95 user, add the following lines to
<code>c:\Autoexec.bat</code>.
<blockquote>
  set HOME=C:
<br>
  set USER=<em>your unix login</em>
<br>
  set CVSROOT=:pserver:%USER%@rashomon.communities.com:/home/cvsroot
</blockquote>
and reboot.

<li>If you are a Windows NT user, open the control panel and click the
'System' icon. Select 'Environment' and type <code>HOME</code>
in the variable field, and then <code>C:</code> in the Value field.
Then click 'Set'. Set the USER and CVSROOT variables in a similar
fashion. Then click 'OK'.
<br>

<li> You need to check out the various bits of the build environment.
Unfortunately you need cvs to do this and cvs is in the build
environment which you don't have yet. So you need a copy of cvs to get
yourself bootstrapped. In an MS-DOS command window, go to the root
directory and then type the following from your <code>c:\</code>
prompt:
<blockquote>
copy \\alexandria\eng\win32\bin\cvs.exe <em>local-dir</em>\cvs.exe
</blockquote>
On Win95 <code>\Windows\Commands</code> is a good choice for
<em>local-dir</em> because it's on your default path, so the local
copy of cvs will always be available even if you lose your build
environment.
<p>
Once you have a local copy of CVS installed you can use it to login
and check out the build environment. If you've never used CVS now's
a good time to look at the
<a href="../cvsdoc/index.html">CVS page</a>,
in particular the section on
<a href="../cvsdoc/cvs-windows.html">using CVS on windows</a>. Note
that you've already set up a <code>CVSROOT</code> variable so you
don't have to give the long
<code>-d :pserver:<em>your_user_name</em>@rashomon.communities.com:/home/cvsroot</code>
argument to each cvs command.
When you're ready, you can login to CVS as follows:
<blockquote>
  <em>local-dir</em>\cvs login
</blockquote>
When prompted, enter your unix login password. Once this
is done you are logged in; you shouldn't need to log in again, even
after a reboot. Once you are logged in, you can type:
<blockquote>
  <em>local-dir</em>\cvs co EC
</blockquote>
When the cvs command finishes you have brought over the core build environment.
Now type:
<blockquote>
  cd EC
<br>
  UpdateIcons.bat
</blockquote>
Which will add some useful shortcuts to your "Program Files" menu.

<li> At this point you will have a few new build-related icons under
'Start Menu', 'Program Files': 4dos, 4dos (Build), 4dos (Cafe),
4dos (Release) and Bash (Build). If you installed on a drive
other than the C: drive these shortcuts may have the wrong drive
number in them; you can fix them by bringing up the properties
panel for the shortcut and correcting the drive letter.
<p>

The 4DOS icons open a MS-DOS-compatible shell which is significantly
_better_ than The Default MS-DOS shell. The Bash icons open a a
unix-ish shell on your PC. See <a href="BASH_vs_4DOS.html">Bash vs 4dos</a>
for a brief comparison of Bash and 4dos.
<p>
The (Build) icons run a batch file which sets a set of environment
variables necessary to use the build environment. (See the
<a href="FAQ.html#BuildRelease">FAQ</a> for more on what the different
shells are for).
Select the 4DOS (Build) icon to start up a build shell (<b>Note:</b>
as of 12/29/97 you may get 2 messages of the form: <code>4DOS:
eC:\EC\ECENVIRONMENT.BAT [119]  Command line too long</code>; these
seem to be harmless). Change directory to "C:\" and type:
<blockquote>
  cvs co src media
</blockquote>
This checks out a local copy of the source tree and the media tree. It
will take a long while to complete. When the checkout completes,
you're ready to build (though if you're building on a drive other than
the C: drive you will need to <code>mount</code> some directories first
- see the <a href="FAQ.html#C:Drive">FAQ</a>).
<p>
When you need to update <code>EC</code>, <code>src</code> or
<code>media</code> in the future you can just use <code>cvs update</code>.
<code>cvs co</code> (which is an abbreviation for <code>cvs checkout</code>)
is only required for the initial checkout. Again, see the
<a href="../cvsdoc/index.html">CVS page</a> for details.

<h2><a name="4DOS">The 4DOS/4NT Shells</a></h2>

4DOS and 4NT are shells for use on Windows95 and NT respectively. They
support piping, redirection, aliases, cdpaths and more. Both have
built in help; just type "help" at the command line.  See <a
href="BASH_vs_4DOS.html">Bash vs 4dos</a> for a brief comparison of
Bash and 4dos.

<h2><a name="analdump">analdump</a></h2>

Chip's memory debugging tool comes with the build environment. Type
analdump in a shell to start it. See the
<a href="../memory/analdump.html">analdump page</a> for more.

<h2><a name="classpath">classpath</a></h2>

A useful little script from Felix, which echoes the current CLASSPATH, one
entry per line

<h2><a name="cleanbuild">cleanbuild.sh</a></h2>

Use from a bash (Build) shell by typing <code>cleanbuild.sh</code> or,
if you want to make your own repository, <code>cleanbuild.sh makerep</code>.
If you're using 4dos you should use bash explicitly e.g.
<code>bash /EC/gnu/bin/cleanbuild.sh</code>.
<p>
The script does the following:
<ul>
<li>removes the /Build directory
<li>cds to /src
<li>moves /EC/FP to /EC/FP-save
<li>makes everything
<li>moves /EC/FP-save back into position (even if make everything fails)
<li>if make everything succeeded, makes release getrep
(or makerep, if you gave it the makerep argument)
</ul>
This gives you a truly clean build, without the danger of /EC/FP
messing things up.
<p>

<b>WARNING:</b> I (Trev) have been very reluctant to check this script
in. I've found it very useful but it has a couple of extremely
annoying bugs:
<ol>
<li>It doesn't reliably delete /Build; even if it does it
takes forever. This is because rm -rf doesn't work properly and
I don't know how to call rd or deltree from a bash script. I tend
to delete /Build manually using rd (or deltree, or the file browser UI).
See the <a href="FAQ.html#rm">FAQ</a> for more on the difficulty of
reliably deleting directories.
<li>Every now and then the script doesn't do the make properly; it seems
to skip parts of it. I've never found out why it does this though I'm
starting to suspect that it happens if I've recently killed a make
with CTRL-C. This seems to be very unreliable on NT, and typically
leaves some part of the make still alive. This zombie make then
screws up subsequent makes.
</ol>

<h2><a name="CVS">CVS</a></h2>

We use the CVS source control system for managing our sources. See
<A HREF="../cvsdoc/index.html">the CVS page</A> for more details.

<h2><a name="GNU">The GNU (Unix Style) Tools</a></h2>

The build environment comes with bash, a Unix style shell, plus many
of the Unix commands (make, cp, mv etc.). These are provided by a
company called Cygnus, who provide the tools for free (and make their
money by consulting?). You can find more techinal info about Cygus on
their <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/techie/">cool tech stuff</a>
page.

<h2><a name="jwhich">jwhich</a></h2>

This is a Java utility that tells you where on the class path you are
finding a given class. To use, type <code>jwhich
<em>full.class.name</em></code>. (<b>As of 12/16/97 jwhich was
broken, probably because its class files are not in the standard build;
in a build shell you can get round this by doing a <code>make</code> in
<code>\src\ec3\E\tools\jwhich</code> before running jwhich</b>).

<h2><a name="less">less</a></h2>

This utility is similar to the Unix more command. Unfortunately it
can get pretty confused by windows where the buffer size is bigger
than the window size, so it's not as much use as you'd think. You
can try <code>type /p</code> if all you want is to type out a file
one page at a time (but it has no searching, no piped input).

<h2><a name="savechanges">savechanges.sh, applychanges.sh and removechanges.sh</a></h2>

These three scripts can be used to share changes between users who each have
different versions of a cvs tree. <code>savechanges.sh</code> packages up
all the modified files in a cvs tree into a single tar file.
<code>applychanges.sh</code> takes a tar file created by
<code>savechanges.sh</code> and updates a cvs tree with the modified files
in the tar file. <code>removechanges.sh</code> takes a tar file and
removes all the files it contains from a cvs tree, then checks out the
current versions of those files.
<p>
All three scripts are shell scripts. They can be run from 4dos by
calling bash explicitly e.g. <code>bash /EC/gnu/bin/savechanges.sh
<em>mytarfile</em></code> (all the scripts are checked in to the
<code>/EC/gnu/bin</code> directory). From bash they can be used
directly, e.g.  <code>savechanges.sh <em>mytarfile</em></code>.
<p>

<dl>

<dt><code>savechanges.sh <em>mytarfile</em></code>
<dd>This command looks in the current directory and all its sub directories
for files which are under cvs control and have been modified. It puts all
of these files into a tar file called <em>mytarfile</em> (if <em>mytarfile</em>
is omitted, it defaults to <code>changes.tar</code>). So, for example, if
Alice had some changes in her tree and she wanted Bob to test them
she'd go to the part of the tree containing all her changes - say
<code>/src/cosm1</code> - and then type <code>savechanges.sh
alice.tar</code>. She could then mail Bob the tar file, together with
the name of the directory in which it was created, <code>/src/cosm1</code>.

<dt><code>applychanges.sh <em>mytarfile</em></code>
<dd>This command looks in the given tarfile (which defaults to
<code>changes.tar</code> if omitted) to get a list of changes to apply.
It then looks in the current directory and checks to see which (if any)
files are under cvs control and are modified. If there is a clash between
these two lists, i.e. the tar file contains a file which is also modified
in the current tree, then <code>applychanges.sh</code> exits with an error
message. This ensures it doesn't overwrite local modifications. Otherwise
it extracts all the changed files from the tarfile and overwrites the
corresponding local (unmodified) files. So, in our example, on receiving
<code>alice.tar</code>, Bob would change to his <code>/src/cosm1</code>
directory and then type <code>applychanges.sh alice.tar</code>. This
would apply all of Alice's changes to his directory tree.

<dt><code>removechanges.sh <em>mytarfile</em></code> <dd> This command
looks in the given tarfile (which defaults to <code>changes.tar</code>
if omitted) and gets a list of changed files.  It removes all these
files from the current directory tree, then <code>cvs updates</code>
them to get the latest checked in versions. In our example, Bob, after
testing Alice's changes, would use <code>removechanges.sh
alice.tar</code> to get his directory tree back to its original
state. You can also do <code>savechanges.sh</code> followed by
<code>removechanges.sh</code> to temporarily back our all changes in
your directory tree (and you can later recover your changes with
<code>applychanges.sh</code>).

</dl>
<b>Known Bugs:</b>

<ul>
<li> The savechanges.sh script always spits out the mysterious message
<code>setgrent called, and it's not done yet</code>, right before it
finishes. This seems to be harmless (it's something to do with Cygnus,
who wrote tar and the other gnu tools, not having implemented the
setgrent system call).
<li> The scripts work if you have added new files to the build (providing
you have cvs added them, savechanges.sh will find them). But they do
<em>not</em> keep track of any files you have removed and, in some cases,
this could mask a build problem from the person you are sharing your
changes with.
<li> None of the scripts work with tar file names that
have a drive specifier at the beginning
e.g. <code>d:\Eudora\Attach\changes.tar</code>. If given such a name,
tar crashes with a "status access violation".  Unfortunately this
seems to be a bash or tar limitation so it's hard to fix. The workaround
is to move the file onto the current drive.
</ul>


<h2><a name="timerizer">timerizer</a></h2>

This utility, provided by Felix, pipes the output of a process into
timerizer. It will tell you the number of seconds elapsed after each
line of output, and then tell you the total time taken at EOF.

<h2><a name="touch1">touch1</a></h2>

Another Felix utility. Like unix touch, touch1.exe creates the file if
the file does not exist and updates the modification time if it does.
(gnu's win32 touch complains and dies if the file doesn't exist)

<h2><a name="vi">vi</a></h2>

Lemmy, a vi clone, comes with the build environment. Just type
<code>vi</code> in a build shell. For more, see the author's
page: <A HREF="http://www.accessone.com/~jai/">James' Pages</A>.

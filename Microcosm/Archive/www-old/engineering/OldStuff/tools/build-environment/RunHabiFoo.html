<A NAME="Run.Bat"></A>How To Test HabiFoo Client/Server Using Run.bat</H2>
(Note; HabiFoos aren't really "client" and "server" at all. HabiFoos are
both servers and clients. But I use "server" and "client" in the following
because it is simpler than saying things like "HabiFoo 1 which is currently
acting as a server")

<P>These instructions don't apply if you've built a full release. Full
releases don't include <TT>Run.bat</TT> because it is not going to be available
to end users. If you've done a normal developer build these instructions
should be fine. You should be using a 4dos (Build) shell.

<P>Testing with a client and server on a single machine causes a lot of
thrashing. Because of this it's handy to use console mode for one of them
(console mode consumes less memory). So the following describes how to
start up a GUI server and a console client, though it also mentions how
to start up both server and client in GUI mode.

<P>After a clean build and assuming you have no pre-existing avatars, you
can go to the Build/Release directory (usually c:\Build\Release on Windows)
and type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>run rlm = <I>realm of your choice</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
If the "rlm = <I>realm of your choice</I>" is omitted, the realm defaults
to Avatar97. This starts up the first avatar, in GUI mode. You should get
the new avatar popup, which allows you to create a new avatar and select
its name, sex and password. Suppose we choose the name "Jill". Once Jill
is up and running you can start a "client" using:
<BLOCKQUOTE>run rlm = GreekTurf rgnFile = PublishedRefs\Jill\Great-Round-Square.mcm
console = true</BLOCKQUOTE>
(This should all be on one line). You can choose another realm instead
of GreekTurf, but you should try to choose one that doesn't contain any
teleport pad names in common with the realm you chose for Jill. I use GreekTurf
because it is just one region, so it starts up pretty quick, and other
realms don't usually have a GreekTurf teleport pad.

<P>The 'rgnFile' argument specifies the teleport pad in your original server
avatar's realm to which client will connect. It must be one of the published
teleport pads (the server prints out the name of these when it starts up).
In this example the avatar is called Jill and I'm assuming the default
realm, Avatar97, which contains a Great Round Square teleport pad (note
that spaces are replaced by -). I typically use filename completion to
complete the rgnFile argument, which avoids typing errors.

<P>On startup the console mode login code allows you to create a new avatar,
choose an existing avatar or exit. Create a new avatar (say Frank) and
then choose that avatar and start up. After a good deal of grinding you
should end up with server and client in the same region, and you can do
your tests.

<P>Note; if you need both client and server to be in GUI mode you can't
just use run.bat to start a client. This is because the initial login popup
only allows you to select one of the avatars you've already created - and
the only avatar you've created is the server, which is already running!
So, in this case, using console mode to create a new avatar is pretty convenient.
You can create a new avatar from the console then exit out of the login
sequence and restart in GUI mode. Alternatively you can use AccountManager
to create a new avatar, but you may need to run regupdate first.

<P>After your initial test you can quit server and client, which will create
checkpoints for Jill and Frank. At this point the realms for these avatars
are fixed (saved in the checkpoint) so you can use run.bat without the
rlm argument for your revival tests. The other arguments - console and
rgnFile - work as before.

<A NAME="AccountManager"></A>How To Test HabiFoo Client/Server Using AccountManager</H2>
You can also use the <TT>AccountManager</TT> to startup and test HabiFoo.
This has important advantages over the <TT>run.bat</TT> approach:
<UL>
<LI>
You are testing the path that users will actually use</LI>

<LI>
It automatically sends the logs to a log file, which means no worries about
important error spam scrolling off your screen.</LI>

<LI>
It works whether you've built a full release or a normal developer build.</LI>
</UL>
On the down side, it's harder to test console mode and it's harder to start
up with custom realms.
<H4>
Running <TT><A HREF="regUpdate.html">regupdate</A></TT></H4>
Before using <TT>AccountManager</TT> you have to run <TT>regupdate</TT>.
<TT>regupdate</TT> stores environment information in the Microsoft registry
so that <TT>AccountManager</TT> can start up HabiFoo in the correct environment.
It also updates the registry with information about the <TT>.mcm</TT> and
<TT>.mcmav</TT> file extensions, so that the system knows how to start
HabiFoo when the user clicks on an <TT>.mcm</TT> or <TT>.mcmav</TT> file.

<P>How you run <TT>regupdate</TT> depends on whether you did a developer
build or a release build. If you did a developer build you should <TT>cd
\Build\Release\bin</TT> and type <TT>.\regupdate -savepaths</TT>. This
saves an environment containing all the paths needed to get at your class
files etc. Because you didn't build a full release these files are <I>not</I>
all in <TT>\Build\Release</TT>, which is why the special <TT>-savepaths</TT>
is needed.

<P>If you did build a full release, you can either double click on the
<TT>regupdate.exe</TT> icon in <TT>\Build\Release\bin</TT>, or <TT>cd \Build\Release\bin</TT>
and type <TT>.\regupdate</TT>.

<P>If you have trouble running <TT>AccountManager</TT> after doing a <TT>regupdate</TT>,
you can troubleshoot in a couple of ways. First you can re-run <TT>regupdate</TT>,
but give it the <TT>-debug</TT> flag (in addition to <TT>-savepaths</TT>,
if you used that). This will give you more spam when you start <TT>AccountManager</TT>.
You can also check the values <TT>regupdate</TT> put into the registry.
Start up Microsoft's <TT>regedit</TT> utility (type <TT>regedit</TT> in
a shell). Then look under <TT>My Computer</TT>, <TT>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
Software, Electric Communities, HabiSplat</TT>. This shows you the environment
used when you run <TT>AccountManager</TT>. Another section, <TT>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
Software, Classess, HabiSplat, Shell, open, command</TT> shows you the
command used to start up HabiFoo.
<H4>
Starting HabiFoo Using <TT>AccountManager</TT></H4>
Once you've run <TT>regedit</TT> you should have an "Account Manager" entry
in your Windows Start Menu. You can start HabiFoo by selecting it. The
<TT>AccountManager</TT> should start up, giving you the choice of creating
a new avatar account or running an existing one. First time up, you won't
get the choice; you'll have to create an avatar because there won't be
any existing ones.

<P>Note that you can also start <TT>AccountManager</TT> by double clicking
on <TT>\build\release\bin\HabiSplat.exe</TT> or
<BR>by running it from a command line. <TT>HabiSplat</TT>, when run with
no arguments, starts <TT>AccountManager</TT>.
<BR>(I apologize for the obfuscation here - there used to be an <TT>AccountManager.exe</TT>,
but it was subsumed by <TT>HabiSplat.exe</TT> - which is a farcical name
and adds even more confusion to the mix. -walendo)

<P>Once you have an account you can hit the Start button to start it up.
Logging information will be sent to a file with a name like <TT>\Build\Release\logs\uCosmLog_0.txt</TT>.
The last part of the name may be <TT>uCosmLog_1.txt</TT> or <TT>uCosmLog_2.txt</TT>,
if you are running multiple HabiFoos simultaneously. The first HabiFoo
to start up is given the number 0, the next 1 and so on. If you want to
see the log while the program is running you can start up a shell and type,
for example, <TT>tail -f \Build\Release\logs\uCosmLog_0.txt</TT>.

<P>By default, HabiFoo will start up in the GreekTurf realm, containing
just the GreekTurf region. If you want to start in a different realm, you
can edit your <TT>/Build/Release/props/default.props</TT> file. Change
the line that says <TT>RealmTextFile=realm/realm.GreekTurf.txt</TT> to
point at the realm text of your choice. <I>Important:</I> this only works
the very first time you start an avatar. Once you've started up and checkpointed
an avatar then its realm is saved in the checkpoint and the realm text
file is irrelevant for any future revivals.

<P>To test "client/server" you can use AccountManager to start up two HabiFoos
with different avatars. You may want to give one of the avatars you set
up a big realm, such as Avatar97, so you can do more extensive testing.
When avatars start up they publish their teleport pads in files of the
form: <TT>\Build\Release\PublishedRefs\<I>avatar-name</I>\<I>region-name</I>.mcm</TT>.
Use the file browser to find these files for the <I>first</I> avatar you
started up. Double clicking on one of these files should teleport the second
avatar into the appropriate place in the first avatar's realm (double clicking
on an <TT>.mcm</TT> should always affect the most recently started instance
of HabiFoo).

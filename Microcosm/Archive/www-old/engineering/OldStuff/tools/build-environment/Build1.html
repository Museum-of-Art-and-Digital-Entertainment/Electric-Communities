<H1>Using BUILD1</H1> 
BUILD1 is a computer dedicated to help you as Build Buddy. The underlying idea is
to use it whenever none of our engineers is available to assist you as build buddy, 
to use it as a third build buddy, or simply to try things on a machine other than 
your own. It is currently located at the cube next to Alison's, by the windows.

<a name="marking"><H2>Marking BUILD1 as Busy or Idle</H2></a>
<UL>
It is important to let other engineers know when you are utilizing BUILD1 as well as 
when it is available for them to use. Bitmaps 'busy' and 'idle' on the desktop can help 
you indicate the status of BUILD1. 
You can open them with MSPaint by double clicking their corresponding icon. 
My recommendation is to expand the window to full screen and, using the View menu option, 
disable Tool Box, Color Box, and Status Bar.<P>

<a name="updating src/media"><H2>Updating src and Media</H2></a>
<UL>
To update BUILD1 and ensure it contains the latest src and media directories do the following.<P>
<LI>Close the src and media directories. This step should not be needed if the previous user 
did clean up before making BUILD1 idle, but doesn't hurt to double check. Then do any of the following if needed.
<LI>Select the 4DOS (Build) icon to start up a build shell (<b>Note:</b>
as of 12/29/97 you may get 2 messages of the form: <code>4DOS:
eC:\EC\ECENVIRONMENT.BAT [119]  Command line too long</code>; these
seem to be harmless).
<LI> Update the build environment directories: 
<blockquote>
  cd \
  cvs update src media
</blockquote>
Alternatively, you can type: 
<blockquote>
  cvs co src media
</blockquote>
just keep in mind this might take longer than cvs update.
</UL>

<a name="tar up"><H2>tar Up Changes</H2></a>
<UL>
To share your changes, independently of the cvs versions on the machines 
you are using try savechanges.sh and applychanges.sh.<P>
<A HREF="BuildTools.html#savechanges">
savechanges.sh</A> packages up all the modified files in a cvs tree into 
a single tar file. 
<A HREF="BuildTools.html#savechanges">
applychanges.sh</A> takes a tar file created by savechanges.sh and updates 
a cvs tree with the modified files in the tar file.
These scripts can be used to share changes between 
users who each have different versions of a cvs tree.
</UL>

<TD>&nbsp;</TD>

<a name="build and test"><H2>Build and Test</H2></a>
<UL>
<LI>If you only need to build the src/cosm1 tree (not E etc.) then 
<A HREF="BuildHabiFoo.html">
build HabiFoo.</a>
 It assumes you have already checked out the EC and src directories 
 (and the media directory if you build your own repository)
<LI>If you need to build the entire source tree (include E, Pluribus etc.) then 
<A HREF="BuildAll.html">
build the entire EC world.</a>
 It assumes you have already checked out the EC, media and src
<P>
<LI>There are two ways to run HabiFoo to test your changes. You can try 
<A HREF="RunHabiFoo.html">
Running HabiFoo</A> in stand alone mode for testing changes that don't depend 
on host/client communication. For tests requiring host/client mode the first 
thing to do is run habifoo in stand alone mode on the machines involved as 
explained in 
<A HREF="RunHabiFoo.html">
Running HabiFoo</A> and then do:
<UL><LI>Identify either your own computer or BUILD1 as host</LI>
<LI>Teleport the host avatar to the turf where tests will take place</A></LI>
<LI>Copy the corresponding turf's .mcm file to a location that can be accessed 
by client.</A></LI>
<LI>From client double-click host's .mcm file. This will teleport client to host's 
turf and both host and client will be able to see and interact with each other.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<LI>If you have to leave BUILD1 alone while your test is still on progress use the 
'Busy' bitmap image to let others know BUILD1 is *still* in use. 
</UL>

<a name="clean up"><H2>Clean Up When Done</H2></a>
<UL>
Once you are done with your testing and before you can allow others to use it make sure to 
do the following.
<LI>Remove all the files you generated that don't belong to current standard build.</LI>
<LI>Close all directories.</LI>
<LI>Empty the recycle bin.</LI>
<LI>Go to the Start menu, click Shutdown and select 'Close all programs and log on 
as a different user'. This ensures the next user won't login as you.</LI>
</UL>

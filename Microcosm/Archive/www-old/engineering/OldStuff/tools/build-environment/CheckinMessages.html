Every code checkin requires two checkin messages. One is a feature of the
CVS source-code control system. This is primarily used by engineers trying
to determine in which revision of a file a particular change had been made.
The other is a social requirement at EC -- every checkin must be followed
by an e-mail message sent to the mailing list ec_checkin. This serves
several purposes, including: notifying testers and other interested parties
which bugs have been fixed so they can plan testing, notifying other engineers
which files have changed so they can consider updating/merging, notifying
other engineers what new code is ready for their followup work, notifying
demo-ers about new features that can now be exercized, notifying project
managers (PERT chart keepers) about project progress, and providing enough
information to ease tracking down problems should they occur. For these
various purposes, we've refined over time guidelines about what each checkin
message should include.
<p><br>
<h2>E-mail checkin messages</h2>

<p>
Here's a simple example of a complete e-mail checkin message. The sections
will be explained below.

<pre>
	Bugs Fixed:       bug #393: hitting the squidgums button crashes HabiFoo
	PERT:             squidgums button bug PERT box done
	UI Ready to Test: squidgums button now displays dancing kangaroo per spec
	Build buddy:      Gordie

	The bug was a missing pair of curly braces following an if statement
	in Squidgums.showKangaroo(). If only I had followed the coding conventions!

<ol>
<li>
Bugs Fixed section
<p>
This section gives the bug number and a brief description of each bug, so any
reader can know what to expect works now without having to look up the bug
number in the bug base. The description can be the title of the bug if the
title is adequately descriptive. If no bugs were fixed this section can be
omitted.
<p>
<li>
PERT section
<p>
This section lists the boxes on the PERT chart that this checkin completes.
It should not list work towards a PERT goal that doesn't complete a box;
the purpose of this section is to let the PERT-keeper-uppers know when to
mark boxes green. If no PERT boxes were completed, this section should still
be present with content "none" (this lets the reader know that the author
didn't forget to mention a PERT box completed).
<p>
<li>
UI Ready to Test section
<p>
This section can be omitted if the only changes are the fixed bugs described
in section 1. Otherwise, it should always be present, so any reader can know
what to expect works now. If no bugs were fixed, and no user-visible changes
were made, this section should still be present with "none" as the content
and a brief explanation of the purpose of the checkin. For example:

    <pre>
    UI Ready to test: none. This is architectural work to support Crowds.</pre>

<p>
<li>
Buddy section
<p>
This gives the buddy's name. If the buddy wasn't asked to perform the full
buddying routine as described on the <a href="BuildofRights.html#buildbuddy">Build of Rights</a> web page, this section should include
a brief explanation of what the buddy did do. For example:

<pre>
    Buddy: Joe (just built and launched, since there were
           no user-visible changes)</pre>

In the rare cases where there was no buddy, this section should say "none"
with a brief explanation of why no buddy was used.


<p>
<li>
A description of the changes made and the files they were made in
<p>Ideally the reader should be able to tell which changes were made in which
files, though this is not always feasible. The description should be complete
enough that it could be useful in tracking down the source of problems later.
In a perfect world, the file names would include the CVS revision number, but
until/unless we find a way to automate this, it isn't practical.
</ol>

<h2>CVS checkin messages</h2>

<p>
Here's a simple example of a complete CVS checkin message:

<pre>
	fixed bug #393

	The bug was a missing pair of curly braces following an if statement
	in Squidgums.showKangaroo(). If only I had followed the coding conventions!
</pre>

CVS checkin messages should include:

<ol>
<li>
The bug numbers of any bugs fixed in this checkin (no description necessary)
<p>
This enables us to use the cvs log command to determine when a bug was fixed,
so we know what release to expect the bug fix in. It also allows locating the
full email checkin message easily.
<p>
<li>
A description of the overall purpose of the changes
<p>
This makes reading through the cvs log output for a given file useful. It
also helps with locating the full email checkin message when there are no
bug numbers to easily search for (this description, combined with the checkin
author and date, should be enough to correlate with the e-mail checkin
message). Copying/pasting the same description in the CVS checkin message
and e-mail checkin message is encouraged.
</ol>

<H1>Ellen's UI Spec</H1>

The user interface specification for EC Habitats is owned by
<A HREF="mailto:ellen@communities.com">Ellen</A>. <A HREF="mailto:sullivan@communities.com">John</A>
helps her maintain it. You can send questions about it to either one of them.

For now, this spec exists only in Word 97 format (that is, Word from Office 97). It can be found
in Alexandria//home/ellen/UISpec - Official/. If there are multiple versions of the spec in this
directory, the latest one is the one with the most recent date as part of its name.

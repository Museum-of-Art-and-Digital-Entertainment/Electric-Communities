<p>
If you need to build the entire source tree (include E, Pluribus etc.)
here's the simple way to do it. It assumes you have already checked
out the EC, media and src. You can actually do most of the separate
steps below in a single command e.g. <code>make everything release
getrep</code>. It is split into separate steps to make it easier to
explain.
<p>
Note that if you want to test a change by "building from scratch" there
is a little more to do; see the <a href="FAQ.html#ScratchBuild">FAQ</a>
for more details. If you want to build a full release, see
<a href="BuildRelease.html">Building a Release</a>.
<p>
You'll need to have Microsoft Developer Studio installed to build the
entire tree, because you'll need to build some native code. See the <a
href="FAQ.html#MSDEV">FAQ</a> for details on installing Studio. You
should also see the <a href="FAQ.html#C:Drive">FAQ</a> if this is your
first build and you are not building on the <code>C:</code> drive.



<h3>Step 1 - Start Shell</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To do
<dd>Start up a 4dos (Build) shell.
<dt>Background
<dd>This starts up a 4dos shell with the <code>PATH</code> and
<code>CLASSPATH</code> set so that it will look for things first in
the local build area then the local release area and finally in the
build environment. This means that any locally compiled changes will
override those in the build environment.
</dl>

<h3>Step 2 - Build The Sources</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To do
<dd><code>cd \src</code> and type <code>make everything</code>
<dt>Background
<dd>This builds all the sources for the runtime,
support and the HabiFoo application. It will take a long time, over two
hours on some machines. The class files and libraries are put into
<code>\Build</code>, which comes first on your <code>PATH</code>
and <code>CLASSPATH</code>. In subsequent
builds, if you use <code>make everything</code>, ecomp and hackdepends always
get rebuilt, but otherwise only changed files should be rebuilt, as you'd
expect.  Note that one of the advantages of the new build environment
is that the cosm classes are all available, pre-built, in the build
environment. So if you are very careful you can just build your
changes in <code>\src\ec3</code> and not rebuild <code>\src\cosm1</code>
at all (but you better be 100% sure your changes don't cause the
<code>\src\cosm1</code> build to break!).
</dl>


<h3>Step 3 - Setting Up The <code>\Build\Release</code> Directory</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To do
<dd>Still in <code>\src</code>, type <code>make release</code>
<dt>Background
<dd>This step creates a <code>\Build\Release</code> directory and
copies or creates the support files needed to run HabiFoo. These files
are: the template.evat file, the realm, catalog and menu text files, the
props files, java, 3rd party DLLs (e.g. Vox, Renderer)
and the (empty) <code>Avatars</code> and <code>Processes</code> directories.
You don't need to rerun this step on subsequent builds unless you need to
recreate one of the files mentioned above.
<p>
If you were building a full release there would be additional work at
this stage - packaging up all your classes into a zipfile and putting
them into <code>\Build\Release</code>.  This what's needed for
a fully self contained release, but it is overkill for day to
day development. See <a href="BuildRelease.html">Building a
Release</a> for details.
</dl>


<h3>Step 4 - Build Or Copy A Repository</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To do
<dd>Still in <code>\src</code> type <code>make makerep</code> (if you
want to build your own repository) or <code>make getrep</code> (if you
want to copy the pre-built one in <code>/home/eng</code>).
<dt>Background
<dd><code>make makerep</code> builds the repository and then moves it
into the release area, <code>\Build\Release</code>. It will take a
long time, up to 20 minutes. Most people can use the pre-built
repository so they should use <code>make getrep</code>, which is
quicker though it still takes some time to copy the repository (which
is over 50MB) across the network.  The reasons why you might build
your own repository are:
<ul>
<li>You want some newly checked in media which is not in the pre-built
repository yet.
<li>You've changed one of the classes that is persisted in the repository
(e.g. Appearance2D) so the pre-built repository won't work for you.
<li>You are on a low bandwidth link, so it's quicker to update just the
changed parts of <code>\media</code> and rebuild your own repository than
to suck the pre-built repository over the wire.
<li>You've changed low level E runtime or serializer classes in such a
way that the pre-built repository is no longer compatible.
</ul>
Note that you should build the repository <em>after</em> building all the
sources, in case there are recent changes in persisted classes such as
Appearance2D that you need to pick up from your newly built classes.
</dl>


<h3>Step 5 - Set Up The Registry</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To Do
<dd> <code>cd \Build\Release\bin</code> and type
<code>.\regupdate -savepaths</code>.
<dt>Background
<dd>This updates the registry so that clicking on <code>mcmav</code>
and <code>mcm</code> files (or selecting "Account Manager" in your 
Windows Start Menu) starts up the AccountManager, from which you can
start HabiFoo. The <code>-savepaths</code> argument is needed so that
AccountManager will pick up libraries and binaries from
<code>\EC</code> and <code>\Build</code> as well as
<code>\Build\Release</code> i.e. it will work even if you haven't
built a standalone release, with all the binaries and class files
packaged up in <code>\Build\Release</code>.  You don't need to do this
step on subsequent rebuilds, unless the path and classpath have
changed.
</dl>


<h3>Step 6 - Running HabiFoo</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To Do
<dd>You can now use <code>run.bat</code> or <code>AccountManager</code> to
start HabiFoo. See
<A href="RunHabiFoo.html">Running the HabiFoo application</a>
</dl>


<h2>Further builds</h2>

Once you've got an initial build you'll want to make changes, merge in
new changes etc. Usually you can just go back to <code>\src</code> and
type <code>make everything</code> again (or you can just use
<code>make</code> in the subdirectories you've changed, if you're
careful about
<A href="IncBuild.html#MakeDependencies">dependencies</a>).
This should rebuild just your changes (though at the moment it will
rebuild hackdepends and ecomp every time, for some reason).  Your
class path is set up to look for class files in
<code>\Build\steward</code>, <code>\Build\crew</code> etc.
<em>before</em> it looks in the standard zip files. This means your
local, newly compiled, changes override anything else.
<p>
You don't have to run <code>make release</code> or <code>make
getrep</code> or <code>make makerep</code> again, because your
<code>\Build\Release</code> directory is already set up and your
repository should still be up to date.
<p>
There are some gotchas to watch out for. See
<A href="IncBuild.html">Incremental Builds</a> for more details.
Before you checkin you need to build "from scratch". There are
more gotchas here; see the <a href="FAQ.html#ScratchBuild">FAQ</a>
for details.

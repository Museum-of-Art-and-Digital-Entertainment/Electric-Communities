<h1>Crowds Implementation</h1>



How real do crowds have to be for the demo? Crowds can be used a

visual device (like ghosts) to cut down the visual complexity in a

region. That seems fairly straightforward. There is also the issue of

really large crowds, where the crowd implementation is split between

multiple servers; does this need to be done by PC Forum? How much needs

to be done for the first release of Microcosm? Seems like a full

implementation is very important for scaling.

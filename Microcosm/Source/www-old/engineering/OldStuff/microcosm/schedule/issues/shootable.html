<h1>Shooters and Shootables</h1>



How do things get shot? Do they have to be "shootable"? If so do we

have to add in a shootable ingredient to all our in world objects

before they can be shot? This introduces a general problem with "Xers"

and "Xables". It's going to be hard to introduce a new Xer object if

you then have to add the Xable ingredient to everything it can

affect. Maybe we can use more general concepts e.g. "damageable" which

could be used in different ways for shooting, stabbing etc. But then

it's harder to build regions which just allow certain kinds of damage

e.g. stabbing but not shooting.

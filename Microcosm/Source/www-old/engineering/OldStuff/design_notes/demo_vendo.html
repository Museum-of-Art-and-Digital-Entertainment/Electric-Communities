<H1>The 1997 PCForum Demo Vending Machine Unum</H1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This design note explains the Demo Vending Machine Unum and key related
ingredients used in Microcosm for the March 1997 PCForum.

<h1>Overview</h1>

The Demo Vending Machine Unum is a very simple unum tailored for 
the Demo to support renting of a contained item by an avatar
with a token of sufficient value. The vending machine also permits
the return of the vended item (by a simple mechanism provided by the
rented item). Such return is the only means of restocking the
vending machine.
<p>
<h1>Vending Machine Unum Details</h1>

The Vending Machine is a Public Container derivative. 
It adds no unum methods beyond what it inherits from Prop.
<p>
Public Container behavior was augmented entirely via the UI Ingredient,
by adding support for a "rent" command.

<h1>Ingredient Details</h1>

<h2>UIVendingMachine</h2>

The UIVendingMachine ingredient is a derivative of the UIProp ingredient.
The only differences are the added "rent" command support and the
elimination of "shoot" support.

The intended pre-conditions for a successful "rent" command were:
<ul>
<li> that the vending machine is not empty. 
<p>
<li> that only the host avatar would rent.
<p>
<li> that the renting(i.e. host) avatar have a token in its
hand. Only one hand of the avatar was ever available for
consideration.
<p>
<li> that the value of the token is not less than the price of
the item to rent.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
If the pre-conditions were meant, expected behavior from the "rent"
handler would be:
<ul>
<li> the token in the renting avatar's hand would be 
decremented by the price of the rented item. In this
demo, this was a gun of assumed price $100.
<p>
<li> that token would be transferred to its pocket.
<p> 
<li> then the rented item would be transferred to the
avatar's hand. 
</ul>
<h1>Problems</h1>

<ul>
<li> The major problem was not getting to the host TOSContainer
ingredients hash table, i.e. to transfer the contained item
to the avatar's hand. This worked okay for a server-only case.
However, the client side hash table  was not updated (i.e.
it was always empty). This is why the vending machine failed
for the demo; part oversight (the TOSContainer getHashtable
method was documented as "evil"), part lack of time (the client
side went untested due to a client avatar immediate exit problem).  
<p>
A VendingMachine ingredient (client simply forwarding) would
have been useful to manage such interactions with the hosted container.
<p>
<li> Could only dispense one item, of the vending machine's choice.
No mechanism was provided to permit selection of contents. 
<p>
<li> Didn't give a copy of the selected contain item, but
rather the item itself. That might be okay for some cases,
but for the demo, that meant that multiple vending machines
were needed so that an avatar and friends could have guns
at the same time.
<p>
<li> Note that the VendingMachineCreator, like other current creators,
doesn't separate construction of unum from input collection.
Inputs are also expected to come from an unum hash table such
as the realm parser prepares. If input collection isn't separated
from construction, runtime generation of an unum would depend
on building up an unum hashtable, which would be superflous 
if a construction-only Creator static method (of undoubtedly many 
arguments) were available. 
<p>
<li>
No mechanism is provided for stocking multiple items, stocking
items of different prices, restocking if purchase rather than
rent were allowed (which is why rental and not purchase was
the option in the demo), storing information about contents
such as kind, restocking policy, copy policy and price.
<p>
<li> There was no control over stocking by the vending machine.
Stocking was simply a function of realm text specification.
<p>
<li>
Display of contents was graphical only. No alternative mechanism
to show contents, e.g. menu or list box, was provided.
<p>
<li>
The price ($100) of a contained item was assumed by the vending
machine. No mechanism was provided by which price per item could be seen.
<p>
<li> There was no visual indication that the display was empty. 
<p>
<li> If an avatar tried to buy when the vending machine was empty,
the token was debited and put in the avatar's pocket, but the
avatar received no gun.
<p>
<li>
"Try" was not implemented. "Return" was not under the vending
machines control, so in fact anything could be stocked via that
command (including the vending machine itself, since the gun
had a reference to the vending machine).
<p>
<li>
No sound was implemented.
<p>
<li> The implementation allowed any containable item to be rented,
but the source code names the contained item a "rifle". As the
deadline approached, the source became incredibly messy.

<H1>Avatar Identity Implementation</H1>

Possible implementation for avatar identity (see
<A href="avatar_identity.html">avatar identity</a>). This
implementation just shows the capability drop off code. The real
avatar identity implementation will have other methods e.g. to
return the avatar's chosen name.

 * receipt and get the capability.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The avatar change region ingredient is the ingredient in the avatar
which knows how to move the avatar between regions, and keeps track of
which region the avatar is in. Moving the avatar between regions has
two parts.  The first is moving the avatar body between the two regions
(see the <A href="avatar_body.html">avatar and avatar body</a>
document for more on the difference between the avatar and the avatar
body). The second is to bring over presences of all objects in the
region and then to change the UI to display the newly entered region.
<p>
The avatar change region ingredient is also used to do body swapping,
when a new body is selected from the avatar catalog. Doing a body
swap introduces a new body into the region, so it shares some of the
code needed to move an avatar body between regions.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

<h5>Changing Regions</h5>

The change region ingredient registers a "change region" behavior with
the avatar's behavior manager (RobJ will be documenting
behaviors). When the user clicks on a portal or a teleport list item
this will result in a call to the behavior, which will call into the
<code>uChangeRegion</code> method of the avatar change region
ingredient.
<p>
The <code>uChangeRegion</code> method basically moves the body into
the new region and then calls into the composition code to display the
newly entered region. In fact, if you look at the code, the meat of it
is a call to <code>moveBodyIntoRegion</code>, followed by a call to
<code>showRegion</code>.
<p>
This seems fairly simple but the error handling is tricky, especially
in the case where the new region throws a TOS exception. In that case
the exception is examined and an alert is displayed. If the TOS
exception was because of an uncertified "in hand" object the alert
allows the user to request the item to be pocketed and then to retry
region entry. This pocketing and retry code is also in avatar change
region.
<p>
When you enter a region, you need presences of all other objects in
the region. This is a complicated task but the composition and
containership code does all the hard work; the avatar change region
ingredient just initiates the containership transfer request and then
calls into the composition code to display the new region once the
transfer is complete.
<p>
Changing a region takes a while, and involves several asynchronous
messages and round trips over the wire. Much confusion would result if
another change region request were to be processed before the current
one finished. To avoid this problem the avatar change region
ingredient maintains channels of pending requests. When a request
arrives it is put in the current pending channel, and a new "pending
channel" is creates. As each request completes, whether it succeeds or
fails, it forwards the next pending channel to the ingredient so the
following request, if any, can get started. All this complicates the
code. Maybe it would be better to have a way to cancel partially
completed requests?

<h5>Body Swapping</h5>

A body swap request makes use of the same
<code>moveBodyIntoRegion</code> method used by <code>uChangeRegion</code>.
However it doesn't need to show the region again. It does:
<ol>
<li>Get old body, and location of old body
<li>Use the avatar body link ingredient to set the new body as the current body
<li>Move the new body into the current region
</ol>
Again the basic idea is simple, but the error handling is horrible; the
new body might fail TOS, or a disconnect might happen half way through the
swap. If so the old body must be put back into place.
<p>
Body swaps are serialized, just like region changes. So each body swap
or region change completes fully (either fully successful or failed and
cleaned up) before the next happens.

<h5>Region of Last Resort and Disconnect Handling</h5>

The avatar body is an unusual containable because it doesn't have a
"container of last resort". A container of last resort is a container
that a containable moves itself into if it loses contact with its
current container.
<p>
But the avatar body is entirely controlled by the avatar. We don't
want it to asynchronously decide to move itself somewhere else, even
if it is disconnected from its region, because that would further
complicate the code in the avatar which moves the body around.
<p>
So, instead, the avatar body has no region of last resort, but when it
loses its containing region it sends a message back to the avatar
change region ingredient. The avatar change region ingredient then
moves the body into the region of last resort, using the usual region
changing code. This also ensures that the move to the region of last
resort is serialized together with any other region changes or body
swaps.

<h5>Teleport Pad Handling</h5>

When the avatar enters a new region it calls into the region to
get the default teleport pad for the region (if any) plus the
list of teleport pads for the current realm. These calls are
made in the avatar change region ingredient, though the real
work is done in the region, realm and teleport list code.

<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>The code is all E/Pluribus code, so it assumes single threading and
does no synchronization or locking.
<li>The code is intended to be robust in the face of a disconnect
happening at any time, including half way through a region transition
or body swap. It certainly needs to be this robust, but I suspect there
are still bugs in there at the moment.
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

Normally this section would contain JavaDoc for the ingredient classes.
Unfortunately JavaDoc doesn't work on Pluribus code. So here's the
full Pluribus kinds for doing region changing and body swapping:

<pre>
  /**
   * Unum avatarChangeRegion interface. Used to move an avatar between
   * regions.
   */
  export kind ukAvatarChangeRegion {

    /**
     * Moves the avatar to the given region. The avatar will use the
     * given transition and appear at the given location.
     * @param newRegion - the new region. Must be an actual unum, not a channel
     * @param transition - the graphical transition to use on moving to the
     *   new region.
     * @param initialLocation - location in new region
     * @param whenDone - If non null, is forwarded to etrue if the region
     *   change succeeds and efalse if the user cancels the transition.
     *   The user may cancel for many reasons including getting a TOS
     *   notice, being refused entry to a hub etc.
     *   Not forwarded if an exception is thrown.
     * @exception eeChangeRegionException - thrown if can't get into the
     *   new region due to network error or some other infrastructure
     *   problem.
     */
    uChangeRegion(kind ukAddUnum newRegion,
                  RegionTransition transition,
                  SurfaceLocation initialLocation,
                  EResult whenDone);
  }


  /**
   * Full ingredient interface; union of unum, presence and ingredient
   * messages (though in this case there's only unum messages)
   */
  export kind iskAvatarChangeRegion {

    /**
     * Go to initial region (i.e. turf) at startup or revival time. The
     * change region ingredient keeps a permanent reference to the initial
     * region, which MUST be locally hosted, so this call should always
     * succeed.
     * <p>
     * In addition this method checks with the avatar receptionist to see
     * if there is an initial teleport location. If so it causes a teleport
     * to that location (AFTER moving the avatar into the turf). This
     * teleport may not succeed, in which case the avatar is left in its
     * turf.
     * @param isRevive - indicates whether this is a revive from checkpoint
     *   or initial startup.
     * @param whenDone - forwarded to etrue when the transition is complete
     * @exception - none
     */
    iGoToInitialRegion(boolean isRevive, EResult whenDone);

    /**
     * Method for swapping the current body for a new, currently uncontained
     * body. Should only be used for locally hosted bodies.
     * Sets the owner of newBody and then puts it into the current region.
     * If there is a TOS exception, swaps it back. If there is a really
     * exception (network error, disconnect) the body swap will always
     * succeed but the avatar will be switched back to its turf.
     * @param newBody - the new body
     * @param whenDone - forwarded to true if body swap succeeds, not
     *   forwarded if exception thrown.
     * @exception eeTOSAddUnumFailed - if body fails TOS of current region
     */
    iSwapBody(kind ukBodySetOwner newBody, EResult whenDone);

    /**
     * Send given envelope to the current region unum
     */
    iSendEnvelopeToCurrentRegionUnum(RtEnvelope envelope);

    /** Unum kind */
    kind ukAvatarChangeRegion;

    /**
     * A couple of body related kinds because this ingredient is in charge
     * of moving the body between regions
     */
    kind ukBodyInNewRegion;
    kind ukBodyRegionDisconnectHandler;
  }
</pre>

The avatar change region ingredient also provides a notification service
that can notify other ingredients whenever the current region changes:

<pre>
  public interface jiRegionChangeNotifier {
      /**
        * Method for registering an object that is interested in hearing
        * about region changes.
        */
      public void iRegisterRegionChangeInterest(eiAvatarChangeRegionInterest obj);

      /**
        * Method for un-registering region change interest object.
        */
      public void iUnRegisterRegionChangeInterest(eiAvatarChangeRegionInterest obj);

  }

  public einterface eiAvatarChangeRegionInterest {
      emethod iNotifyRegionChange(Unum currentRegion);
  }
</pre>

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<ul>
<li>Turn on the "changeregion" trace category to get tracing during region
transitions and body swaps.
</ul>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>Like the avatar to body link the avatar change region ingredient will
probably change out of recognition (and hopefully become <em>much</em>
simpler) when containership is re-written.
<li>If the current code does need to be maintained error handling is
probably the area most in need of improvement. The current code
assumes that the body containership transfer done during a region
transition will either succeed or throw an exception but not both. In
practice this isn't true, which leads to assertion failures in the
current code. Some of this is due to unexpected, non fatal, exceptions
being propogated up the E causality chain when they shouldn't be. But
there is also a legitimate case where a transition could succeed but
then see an exception - if the transition succeeds just before a network
partition. In that case the disconnect exception may get propogated to
the original exception environment before it gets garbage collected,
even though the request has successfully completed.

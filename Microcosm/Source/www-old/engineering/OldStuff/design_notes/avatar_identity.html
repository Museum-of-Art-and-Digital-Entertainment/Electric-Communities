<h2>Introduction</h2>

This design note describes a way of handing capabilities to avatars in
a secure way. To do this you need a way of describing avatar identity.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Suppose you see an advertisement in a paper which gives a name and PO
box number. You respond to the ad, giving your name and PO box number.
Over time you build up a relationship with the owner of the PO box
(let's call them Alice) by sending mail to each other. Then, one day,
you get a letter from Alice asking for a loan. At this point you have
to decide, based on your correspondence, whether or not you trust
Alice. But one thing you don't have to worry about is whether the
request is really from Alice. You'll be sending the money to Alice's
PO box, which is your only point of contact. If someone other than
Alice is trying to scam you, all they can achieve is to give Alice an
unexpected loan. (This assumes you can trust the postal service to
deliver your money!).

<p>

Avatar identity in Microcosm works in a very similar way.  An
avatar's manifestations in the world (e.g. body, word balloons) are
all marked with the avatar's "identity address" - actually a
persistent object reference. As with the PO box example, in Microcosm
you come to trust someone who is identified by a unique (if rather
incomprehensible) identifier - an avatar's identity address is like
Alice's PO box number. Similarly, when you want to give capabilities
to an avatar you give them to the identity address you have come to
trust, just as you sent money to Alice's PO box.

<h2>Details of Identity Addresses</h2>

Avatar identity addresses are not presented to the user directly;
instead the avatar's chosen name is shown (more on this
later). However your session does take note of identity addresses; your
address book, for example, keeps track of people by identity address,
though it only shows you the user visible information associated with
an avatar.

<p>

The object that the identity address points to (we'll call it the
"identity object") is, among other things, a "capability drop off
point".  When an avatar asks you for a capability (e.g. the capability
to send telepathy to you), it accompanies the request with its
identity address.  You then deposit the capability in the
corresponding identity object. 

<p>

So suppose Bob tries to fool you by asking you for a capability, but
giving Alice's identity address. You check what kind of capabilities
you're prepared to give Alice (because you think that's who's asking).
You then deposit the appropriate capability in Alice's identity
object. Bob hasn't achieved anything except to give Alice a capability
that you're happy to give her.

<p>

Before you deposit a capability in someone's identity object you mark
it with their identity address (this is an example of a "filler
capability"). This means that when they use the capability, the
"filler" part will ensure that all their requests are marked with
their identity address. This lets you know who is responsible for each
incoming request, so if someone starts abusing the capabilities you've
given them you can selectively revoke all capabilities marked with
their identity address.

<p>

So using this system you can give out capabilities and know they are
going to the intended recipient. And when requests come in via a given
capability, you know who is responsible. Note that the usual
capability properties apply. If you give a capability to Alice she can
then pass it on to Bob. If Bob uses it, the request will come in
marked with Alice's identity address. In this case the actual requestor
is Bob, but the responsible party is still Alice. Part of trusting
Alice with a capability is trusting that she won't give it to anyone
you don't think should have it.


<h2>Names</h2>

We don't want identity addresses turning up in the UI because they
will be stringified object references - long, incomprehensible URLs
with no meaning for the user.  So each avatar can choose a name which
will accompany their identity address. Furthermore you can choose your
own "pet name" for each avatar you encounter.

<p>

So suppose you meet an avatar called Alice (i.e. Alice is the name she
has chosen for herself). You can then add your own pet name (e.g. "My
buddy Alice"). Your address book will associate both names with
Alice's identity address. If Alice changes her name to Alicia your
address book will still be able to identify her by her identity address
and can retrieve her old name and your pet name for her. Which name
(or combination of names) gets presented in the UI is still being
decided, but the address book will have enough information to support
several approaches.

<h2>Avatars and Regions</h2>

The avatar identity isn't just useful for direct communication between
avatars (e.g. telepathy). It's also important for communication within
a region. When you go into a region you are trusting it to show you
what is inside it. And you also trust it to manage the conversation
that goes on inside the region.

<p>

We have to trust the region. But we don't want to trust everyone
else within the region. How can we make sure that the avatars and
word ballons we see are associated with the correct people? What's
to stop Alice entering a region, claiming to be Bob? She could then
ruin Bob's reputation by saying and doing un-Boblike things.

<p>

Again the identity address provides a solution. Let's take speech as
an example. On entering the region Alice is given a facet (i.e.
capability) that allows her to participate in the region's
conversation. This facet makes sure that anything she said is marked
as "coming from Alice". This fits nicely with the identity
address. Alice says to the region "I'm Alice, I want to talk in the
region, and here's my identity address". The region then produces a
filler facet, irreversibly marked with Alice's identity address, and
puts it into Alice's identity object. If Alice is who she says she is,
she can go to her identity object, get the facet and thereby talk in
the region.

<h2>The Postal Service and the Com System</h2>

In our original analogy, you had to trust the postal service to
deliver the money to the right PO box. It would be no good sending the
money to Alice's PO box if the scammer could intercept the mail.

<p>

In Microcosm the Com System plays the part of the Postal Service.
And the Com System is secure. An E object reference, such as
the identity address, has the property that no-one can pretend to
be the object referred to by that reference. Only the real object
will receive any messages sent to that reference.

<h2>Proposed Interfaces</h2>

One possible avatar identity object would be:

<p><code>
    emethod giveCapability(EObject capability,
                           EDistributor receiptDistributor);
<p>
    emethod getCapabilityForReceipt(ECapabilityReceipt receipt,
                                    EDistributor capabilityDistributor);
</code><p>

The <code>giveCapability</code> method should be widely available -
anyone can call it. The <code>getCapabilityForReceipt</code> method
should be closely held; only the owner of the avatar should be able
to use it (the two methods may, in fact, end up being on different
objects, but conceptually they're public and private facets of the
same avatar).

<p>

So suppose an avatar wants to get into a region. Some facet of the
avatar asks some facet of the region for a conversation capability,
giving the avatar's identity address as an argument. The region then
creates the conversation capability, marks it with the identity
address, and calls <code>giveCapability</code> on the identity
object. In return it gets a channel to a receipt, which it gives to
the facet of the avatar. If the avatar really does own the identity it
can get at the <code>getCapabilityForReceipt</code> method and can
redeem and use the actual capability.

<p>

This protocol involves a round trip to set up the capability. Once the
capability is in place, though, the avatar can use it to talk within
the region without any further round trips or checking.

<p>

Note that the real avatar identity object will have other methods apart
from the ones shown above. The methods above are just the ones needed
for capability drop off.

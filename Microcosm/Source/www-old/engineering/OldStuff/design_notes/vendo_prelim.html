<H1> Microcosm Vending Una/Ingredients Preliminary Notes </H1>

<H1> Introduction </H1>

        This largely informal note explores a proposed Vending ingredient
        to support a variety of Vending Una: kinds of vending machines
        and other kinds of Vending una such as self-vending una.
				I wanted to pull what I currently knew
				or misunderstood about vending together in one place.
        The core design come from Arturo, any confused
        embellishements are mine.  Once clearer requirements
				are set, some/much of this could change. 
         
<P>
        As an example and initial test vehicle for the Vending 
        ingredient, a ProtoVendo unum is described which can be 
        implemented now without requirement of UI or RealmParser 
        changes.
<P>        
        <EM>Disclaimer: </EM> Since design specs have not been completed, it
         may not cover all needs. Rather, it is intended to reflect 
        my current understanding of vending issues as well
        as a design for a prototype vending ingredient and
        vending machine unum (which hopefully will cover (or elicit) 
				 most needs). 
<H1> Ingredient Overview </H1>

The ingredient design realizes:
<UL>
<LI>          vendable content neutrality: 
        the  vending ingredient knows 
        (beyond possible instance reference possession)  about 
        its vendable content only via  stocking info that is
        external to the vendable unum class and instance. All or
        any vendable contents (and/or information about) may
        vary from one moment to the next [subject only to 
        administrative capability and possible temporal consistency 
        advisements, e.g. "in the midst of purchase"].   
<P>
<LI>		  presentation neutrality: a vending ingredient makes
         no presentational decisions and imposes no presentational
        demands. The presentation of any vendable may be changed
        (subject to only to administrative capability. That's not
        to say this is adviseable, just that the vending ingredient
        doesn't care).
<P>
<LI> vending container neutrality: 
        any vendable such that it is vendable is so only due to stock 
        info and possibly being an instance in a vending ingredient
        container, but does not have any internal knowledge of 
        whether vendable.
        (what about the "try" or "rent" cases, doesn't it have
        state as to what vending machine to return to? Doesn't
        having TOS try criteria imply vended or is there a more
        general "can't leave" critera).
</UL>

        One implication of neutrality is that the Amix content 
        wrapper scheme for abstract goods should not require any 
        changes to this vending design (or to the content
        wrapper).
        
<H1> Ingredient Design </H1>

<H2>        Distributed Architecture </H2>

        Client-server, with forwarding-only clients.


<H2>        Protocols </H2>

        The Vending ingredient supports selling, rent/return,
        or trying a product. Three protocols are supported:
<UL>
<LI>                stock (inventory) management

<LI>							 product presentation (i.e. as needed for unum user 
                        interfaces) (stocking shelves)

<LI>               product acquisition (buying, renting/returning, 
                        trying/returning) including token management.
                        (cashier)        
</UL>        
<H2>        State </H2>

        A collection of VendingStockInfo objects. Note that this
        groups a combination of state to support each of the
        3 vending protocols, namely inventory state, 
        presentation state (is this a subset of inventory state?),
        and acquisition state. At some point separate ingredients
        for each protocol may be desirable.
<P>
        Here are the elements of VendingStockInfo:
<PRE>
        // whether the user get a generated clone or a 
        // contained instance
        bool generate

        // optional override of the item description
        String description

        // a price in Tokens (hard value now, later condition to
        // meet in order to acquire which could be expressed via a 
        // static method
        int price

        // how many in stock, -1 means infinite else N > 0 
        int stockAmount
        
        // if giving instance, its key. What about supporting 
        // an array of
        jUnumKey instanceKey        

        // presentation information for item display
        jsbPresentatableState presentation

        // if giving clone, a class with a realmParser create 
        // function(*) 
        Class generatorClass

        // if giving clone, instance values in realmParser 
        // hashTable form
        HashTable generatorInput

        ===============================================================
</PRE>        
<EM>
  Due to changes, jsbPresentableState and specific creator classes
	have been eliminated. Likely replacements  are "PresentationState" for jsbPresentableState and "String type" for "Class generatorClass". 
</EM>                        
<P>
        May want to represent the 2 types based on whether generating
        or not by separate classes, selectable based on the generate
        flag.
<P>
        Having VendingStockInfo support a toString like method would
        get meta info in a cheap way, i.e. as a fixed order string.
<P>
        Haven't included statistics on inventory, e.g. number sold as
        in Jeff's Shrinkwarp bundle.
<P>
        If taking token objects rather than debiting, need state to
        hold these.
<P>
        Assumes a TOSContainer neighbor (etc) to hold instances.
<P>
<H2>    Methods </H2>

<H3>      Stock management protocol</H3>
        
        Insert, delete, and update of inventory entries (the later 2
        operations imply a select operation). Initially
        may implement "insert" only, which matches WA vendo stock
        management. However, dynamic restocking should be possible,
        hence delete and update support is needed, implying one or
        more keys to access inventory entries (e.g. description).

<H3>     Product presentation protocol </H3>
        
        Given that presentation information is part of the inventory
        entry, this protocol is simply one or more accessors to
        the presentation portion of the inventory entry. The
        vending machine stores and makes presentation information
        available via these accessors, but otherwise ignores it. 

<H3>    Product acquisition protocol </H3>

        Support for a vendo's choice of one of more of the buy, 
        perhaps rent/return, and try/return operations.  
<P> 
       Buy and try share an underlying "give" operation. Buy and 
        rent share an underlying "cost" (or payment) operation. 
        "Try" adds underlying "set/unset TOS try criteria" operation. 
        "Return" is supported by a restock operation, which is 
        realized by an "inventory update"
        operation (which implies a "renter" or renter's agent must
        have capability to restock or at least the a check is made
        as to whether the vendo stocks such an item. But how
        is that capability obtained since it was originally given
        to an instance but a clone may have been rented: the
        initial creation being contained in the vendo will
        insure that it gets the proper capability (and for
        just that vendo).
<P>
         If capability wasn't necessary to add an item of a
        kind in the vendo's inventory
        , an avatar could stuff a vendo full of more
        inventory (or possibly slightly different) than its 
        administrator expected. Would that ever be a problem?). 
        Another implication of "return"
        is that inventory records not be deleted upon going to 0.
        [ Perhaps no such return will be implemented for una, if
        a pawn machine is available, but someone may want to implement
        rent/return as was intended for PCForum]. 
<P>
        So an inventory state of rented and try count may be necessary.
        [Perhaps also some limit will be desired on how much an 
        avatar can try].
<P>
        So to start with, operations needed for unum buying are 
<UL>
<LI>                cost
<LI>                give
</UL>
        then for unum trying also
<UL>
<LI>                TOS_set_try_criteria
<LI>                TOS_unset_try_criteria
<LI>                return_stock (with proper capability management)
</UL>
        [Probably the vending ingredient also wants higher level
        operations like "buy", "rent" etc to relieve the ui ingredient
        from having to be aware of compound operations].
<P>
        If "rent/return" is implemented, some policy to enforce
        "return" may be needed by the vending unum. The vending 
        ingredient may support that by keeping tracking of rentals
        (does that mean keeping track of the renting avatar?). It's
        not clear if such support which many unums using a vending
        ingredient may need belongs in the vending ingredient itself
        or in a separate shared renting ingredient. although
        rental management seems an aspect of inventory management.
<P>
<H2>    Security </H2>

        Unum/presence facets should be used to grant a capability
        to manage inventory. 
<P>
        Making state accessible to neighboring ingredients, 
        i.e. user interface, is within a trust boundary. 
<P>
        Acquisition of vended items is by payment or under TOS
        restriction on the item (for "try") and needs no
        special security support. 

<H1> Una Overview </H1>

        The vending ingredient should not contain any restriction
        as to when stocking is done. So a vending unum is not
        restricted to startup-only stocking (as apparently was
        the case in WA). 
<P>
        Stocking operations will be restricted to those items granted
        the capability to do so. The direct capability will be
        granted at startup by the init containership mechanism.
<P>
        As long as the stocking api is satisfied by a caller
        with a capability to stock, the vending ingredient will
        accept the request. The vending ingredient is ignorant
        of any specifics about the stock itself, it only cares
        about the stocking information that allows it to manage
        the stock. That means that there is no requirement
        imposed by the vending ingredient that requires
        stocking information to be part of a vended item
        (beyond presentation information which any Microcosm
        unum would already need). The stocking information
        can wrap the vendable instance information. This
        means changes to unum creators are not required
        to make an unum instance vendable. 
<P>
        The vending ingredient is also unconcerned to how the
        vending unum chooses to present the vended goods in stock,
        only assuming the responsibility of storing and making
        available presentation information for use by the vending
        unum. The vending ingredient can make meta-information
        available for use by a controller (e.g. price, 
        amount in stock...). 
<P>
        This means that (assuming the stock information does include
        sufficient presentation information about the vended stock),
         no change should be required when changing or adding
        the vending unum's display of the vended contents.
        The design supports at least the following presentations:
<UL>
<P>
<LI>                WA cycle through vending machine view
<P>
<LI>                a candy machine (1 image per kind) style view
<P>
<LI>                Glass as used in PCForum 
<P>
<LI>                an out of world window
<P>
<LI>                list box (as PCForum pocket open was).
</UL>   
        However, additional work (such as slotted presention, display
        of meta (in this case stock) info) will be needed on the UI
        side to effectively present vending machines in some of the
        desirable ways).         
<P>        
        A vending ingredient may be used to construct vending una
        other than conventional vending machines. For example:
<UL>
<P> 
<LI>             self-vending by having an unum that has
                a vending ingredient that stocks information about
                its own kind as cloneable.
<P>
<LI>                 group-vending by having a group of unum that
                share a vending ingredient. This could be used
                to implement a store. It's similar to a glass
                vending machine but reversed such that UI events go
                direct to the vendable items (so the glass machine
                doesn't have to locate the selected contents). It's
                similar to self-vending except for the centralized
                vending manager. It would have the advantage that
								customers would not have to queue up due to
								one-at-a-time interaction.
</UL>        
        The vending unum can choose which of the variety of kinds 
        product acquisition it wishes to implement (buy, rent, try) 
        with the support functionality supplied by the vending 
        ingredient.
<P>        
        When ownership is implemented, it will become possible to 
        own one or more vending una. This suggests an additional
        interface will be needed to manage tokens that a vending
        unum may collect and also an interface for being owned
        (possible registration of the vending ingredient so
        owner can manage it, as with other owned una). [Clarify: 
        current design gives capability to each vendable item to supply
        stock information. Is that the same capability object? Didn't
        think so, thought just instances of same facet class. How
        does the vendable ingredient keep track of that should it
        ever want to revoke the capability? Once owner, can give
        it a capability, but then why would we want the vended
        instances to also have that direct capability (i.e. would
        we want them to go thru owner? Seems owner owns vendo
        and the vendable items in it...]
                
<H1> ProtoVendo Design </H1>
        It should be possible now to implement a simple vending 
        machine unum that uses a vending ingredient,
        say initially supporting among the acquisition protocol just
         "buy", using a self-implemented display of contents in the 
        UI ingredient of the unum  via a list box
        (as pocket open did) and using realm text (without change
        in the parser or creators) to do startup-only stocking.
        To further simplify, the first version will not use
        a stocking administrative facet.  
<P>
        Let's call this the ProtoVendo unum. It's a simple but
        unhacked vending unum using an unhacked but rather complete
        vending ingredient. Any changes between this ingredient
        and the final one for product release should be evolutionary
        additions or optimizations.
<P>
        Here's what realm text might look like to get a vended item
        into a vending machine (with some superfluous detail omitted).
        In this case, the vending machine would be stocked with
        10 copies (on demand) of a cloneable gun for 553 tokens each.
        [Dave said this would be reasonable for realm text generation].
<PRE>
        Create Unum VendingMachine
            Name "Gun Dispenser"
            LabelKey "LABEL:TestVendingMachine"
            ...

>>              Generate 1
>>              Description "Coolest Gun Yet"
>>              Price 553
>>              Amount 10
>>              [Unum]CreatorClass "ec.cosm.agency.GunCreator"
                Create Unum GunProp
                   Name "Purchasable Gun"
                   Description "It's a blast!"
                   ImageFile "Gun2.ppm"
                   LabelKey "LABEL:Gun"
                   MenuKey "MENU:GUN"                              
                   Position -3.8  8  1.3
                   AnchorPoint 256 394
                   Scale .3
                   Size 71  389

                   UnumCreatorClass "ec.cosm.agency.GunCreator"
                End Unum
>>            End Unum                
        End Unum
</PRE>
        Note that no change to the GunProp specification is
        required to make it vendable, that is done by
        wrapping it with a "Create Stock" block. 
<P>
        Note that multiple contents would be implemented by
        additional "Create Unum Stock" blocks (each enclosing one
        or more item blocks to be sold under those conditions).
<P>
        The current realm text parser does not support "Create Stock"
        as such (or any CreatorClass besides UnumCreatorClass), but
        "Create Unum" and "Unum Creator Class" do not currently 
        require  that an unum be created, so they can be used as they
         are (returning a null Unum) to get the Stock wrapper layer.
        Later realm text could be modified to support such a
        case more formally, for example by allowing syntax for
        a variable state array (which can have embedded unum 
        instances).  
<P>
<H1> Related Issues </H1>

        The implication of initialization via the  haberdashery has
        not been investigated. However, the requirement (for a
        java object initializer) was a need already noted in the
        haberdashery spec (and which other una/ingredients will need).
<P>         
        It is presumed that if a vended item is subject to scarcity
        that management of that scarcity and its vendability are
        orthogonal issues, e.g. scarcity of cloneable objects is
        a more general problem that for the vending ingredient,
        except that stocking information may be constrained by
        scarcity regulation (i.e. saying an item may be cloned
        infinitely or that 100 copies may be made would not
        be true if scarcity rules limited Microcosm to 10 copies
        of that item. So the vending ingredient will need an 
        appropriate interface to the scarcity manager (so as not to
        take money and then find it can't make a copy). [This may
        have implications for the current mechanism which even
        if cloning is chosen makes an instance in order to get
        information needed to clone. It is possible, however, to
        modify unum creators so that unums optionally are not
        made (but the arguments that would have gone to "new"
        are gathered nevertheless for stocking information).

<H1> Notes </H1>
<OL>        
<P>
<LI>        How to get at the TOS key (so that vending ingredient can
        lookup an instance)? 
<P>
<LI>        [ Note that the TOSbundle and LimitedUseBundle resemble
        the VendingStockInfo ].
<P>
<LI>        Keep pawn machine in mind, since it reverses this more or less.
<P>
<LI>        Haven't addressed use of sound, animation in a Vending Machine
        unum (or other spec of the Vending Machine unum). Focusing
        now on the ingredient.
<P>
<LI>        How to do the TOS Criteria for "try"? Compare the TOS Criteria
        in PCForum that kept gun from going into region (carried by
        avatar). 
<P>
<LI>        Note from Arturo: careful re unum references, don't want to 
        drag in world
<P>
<LI>  If price isn't with the vended item unum instance itself,
 how will the pawn machine determine how much to pay? How
is the price/value determined in general and under what security? 
To draw from the real world, suppose an item came with a cost 
and suggested retail price, but the vending machine or store owner
set a price (which could change, as in sales) and that price
was "stamped" on the item. Or the item might just be identifiable
(as bar codes permit in the real world) and the price is kept
elsewhere, found by lookup based on the item identifier.
<P>
<LI>  In WA, a speech baloon associated with vendo showed
current item and price.

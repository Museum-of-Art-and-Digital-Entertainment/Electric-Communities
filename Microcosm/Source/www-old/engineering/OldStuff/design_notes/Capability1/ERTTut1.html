<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>Secure transactions on the Internet rely, in general, on security mechanisms
that give too much responsibility or too much freedom to users. This implies
an undesirable high risk factor to people interested on secured transactions.
E offers capability-based security concepts that allow true security. This
tutorial introduces a simple true security mechanism for exclusive-rights
transfer.</P>

<P><B>The right over <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT></B></P>

<P>The case described here consists on three objects, <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT>,
<FONT FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT> and <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>
(see Figure 1). <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT> and <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT>
both send independent messages to <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>,
but since only <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT> has capability, exclusive
rights, over <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>, all messages from <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT>
cannot be sent and accumulate in the corresponding channel (see Figure
1). The capability <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT> has over <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>
is actually granted by a trusted third party object <FONT FACE="Courier">Truster1</FONT>,
which gets a message and forwards it to <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>.</P>

<P>To send messages in E it is necessary to store a message in a channel
and send it via a distributor. In Figure 1, channels are represented as
funnels and distributors as triangle-shaped nozzles. So for <FONT FACE="Courier">Sender1</FONT>
the message in its channel is sent through its funnel-nozzle to <FONT FACE="Courier">Truster1</FONT>
and from there to <FONT FACE="Courier">Receiver</FONT>. On the other hand,
<FONT FACE="Courier">Sender2</FONT> cannot send the message contained in
its channel due to the lack of rights, thus no nozzle, to send its message.</P>

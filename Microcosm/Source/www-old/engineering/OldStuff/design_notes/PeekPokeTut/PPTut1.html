<B><P>Summary</P></B>
<P>The Pluribus language was developed to describe Electric
Communities' Distributed object
Model.  The basic element of this model is the unum. In this
tutorial a model for the creation
of two Una to allow communication amongst distributed objects is
introduced. The code needed
to generate a framework for the Una environment and the code needed
to establish the
communication between a server, henceforth host, and a client is
presented in Part One. This
is the fundamental host/server model from which other behavior can
be implemented. The code
for a multi-client environment, in which a message is securely
spread to all clients is
introduced in Part Two. In addition to behavior, an Unum may have a
state that holds on host
and clients and is not sent as a message but handled inside the unum
itself. States are
presented in Part Three.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT><P>An unum is an object whose state and behavior can be
spread across agencies and is
represented in an agency as a presence. Presences consist of
traditional-style objects called
ingredients that provide the actual code for the presence.</P>

<P>A sample presence with a description of its elements is shown in
Figure 1. The vertical
dotted line on the right denotes, graphically, the limit of a
presence implementation with
respect to others. At the outermost layer is the Unum Structure Kind
which is simply the set
of unum interfaces utilized to communicate with the unum. This
interfaces are the same for all
presences of the unum.  The Unum Structure groups all Presence
Structures of the unum and
define which presence is to be the prime, i.e., the host presence.
The Unum Implementation
associates these structures with their respective implementations.
The Presence Structure Kind
is the set of presence interfaces for communication with other
presences. The Presence
Structure groups,for each unum kind,its ingredient and the means to
route both unum messages
and presence messages to the ingredient implementation. In the
Presence Implementation the
constituent ingredients are actually defined and the behavior when a
new client is created is
determined. The Ingredient Structure Kind groups the ingredients of
the presence by kind and
it is the Ingredient Implementation where the ingredients, presences
and una are instantiated.
For a detailed description see Chapter 1 of the Pluribus
Programmer's Manual.

In Figure 1 the Presence Structure for two unum kinds is depicted.
The bold ones represent the
unum kinds whereas the single ones represent presence kinds. Note
that graphically identical
kinds connected through an arrow are actually the same one kind and
not two separate ones. In
general, any number of unum and presence kinds is allowed in an
implementation. The only
consideration is that there should be as many unum kinds as presence
kinds in an unum. Details
of each one of these elements will be discussed in detail next.</P>

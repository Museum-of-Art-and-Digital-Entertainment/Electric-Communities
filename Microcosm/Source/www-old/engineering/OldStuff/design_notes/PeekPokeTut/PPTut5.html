<B><P>Step 2. Determine Presence Components</P>
</B>
<P>The structure for a host/client architecture requires two presence structures per
unum kind. One is the client presence and the other one the host presence. As can be
seen in Figure 2, there are two sets of Peekable and Pokeable presence kinds (pk),
each one enclosed within a presence structure kind (psk), again one for the Host and
one for the Client.</P>

<P><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></P>

</FONT><P>The corresponding code is shown below. Presence kinds and presence structure
kinds are also interfaces, like those for the unum.  The difference consists in that
the presence kinds are utilized exclusively for communication with other
presences.</P>

	// ----- Create Presence structure kind -----
	export kind pkHostPeekable {
	  pHostPeek(String pokeMessage);
	}
	export kind pkHostPokeable {
	  pHostPoke(String pokeMessage);
	}
	export kind pskHostPeekPokeAble {
	  kind pkHostPeekable;
	  kind pkHostPokeable;
	}

	export kind pkClientPeekable {
	  pClientPeek(String pokeMessage);
	}
	export kind pkClientPokeable {
	  pClientPoke(String pokeMessage);
	}
	export kind pskClientPeekablePokeable {
	  kind pkClientPeekable;
	  kind pkClientPokeable;
	}

</FONT><P>The motivation behind having a host and a client resides in that a client
makes a request to the host and it is up to the host to actually attend such
request.</P>
</FONT><P>The code for both Peekable and Pokeable are integrated here for simplicity.
It is not necessary to do so and the code for each of them could well be in a separate
file.  In general, the organization presented here is the one recommended by EC since
it is in accordance with EC's coding standards.</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>FIRST PROTOCOL VERSION 3:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Change history:</P>

<UL>
<LI>protocol1v3: integrated Paul’s comments, fleshed out uSetRoot description for Brian, added location parameter as appropriate</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This document walks through the containment protocol for the following configuration of objects.  Note that some messages (uFlush, uParentAddUnum, uRemove) are only sent to a container’s parent if the container is not the root.  Since any container may or may not be the root, there are cases in this protocol writeup where the message flow would be different if, for example, OC was actually a root—i.e. was actually OR.  These cases are not called out explicitly; it is the case that OC and NC show the behavior of non-root containers when receiving these messages, and OR and NR show the behavior of root containers when receiving these messages.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Also, in any instance where a container sends a message to its parent, it is the case that if there are additional parents between that container and the root, the message will be handled identically by each such parent; for example, uFlush, uParentAddUnum, and uRemove requests all propagate all the way up the parent chain however long it is. </P>

<I>Commentary: As of now, Cb is in transit as far as its children are concerned.  Cb is syncing with its upwards parents.  Note that until the uFlushAck is received, Cb may still be subject to messages from above, so we do not put CbfsupOC into a queueing state until the uFlushAck completes. </I><BR>
<I>Also note that Cbqueueparent is different from Cbnewparent!  Cbqueueparent is the channel into which messages from below go until we commit or abort.  Cbnewparent is the channel that gets hooked up to NCfsupCb as soon as NC processes uAddUnum.  &amp;Cbqueueparent<FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#223;</FONT>
forward(Cbnewparent) will happen if we commit; &amp;Cbqueueparent <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#223;</FONT>
 forward(Cboldparent) will happen if we abort (step 20).</I> <BR>
<I>Cbfrozenchildtree is an addition of Arturo’s after he noticed the following race.  When we get u{Parent}{Add,Remove}Unum messages from our children, we immediately update Cbchildtree and then relay the messages to Cbparent.  If we are in transit (i.e. Cbintransit is true) and waiting for an uFlushAck (i.e. we are between this step and step#17),  and we receive such a message from a kid, then we will be updating Cbchildtree in a way that our parents don’t know about yet.  Then if we pass that updated childtree off to uAddUnum we will be propagating uncommitted state.</I> <BR>
<I>The fix is either to queue all changes to Cbchildtree (not just all messages to Cbparent), or to make a snapshot of Cbchildtree and send <U>that</U> to uAddUnum when the time comes.  We take the latter strategy, creating Cbfrozenchildtree, and updating it only with uParentAddFailed messages from above.</I><BR>

<I>Commentary: As of now, OC has &quot;given permission&quot; for Cb to leave, but as far as OC is concerned Cb is still its child.  However, in the next step, CbfsupOC goes into a queueing state until either Cb commits (in which case all such messages get dropped—we need a way to make this throw exceptions appropriately), or until Cb aborts, in which case those queued messages will get forwarded.</LI>

<I>Commentary: As of this point, we have created a facet to support our new container, but we don’t yet know whether we are <U>in</U> our new container.

<I>Commentary:  As of now, Cb is a child of NC.  NC may attempt to send it containment messages via CbfsupNC. Cb won’t process these messages until CbfsupNC gets changed out of queueing mode, which happens below in uSetParent. <BR>
Note that right here is one motivation for Cbfrozenchildtree.  Consider what would happen if NC were in transit here.  If NCintransit, then NCchildtree as of right now is being updated with children that may not eventually make it in.  We do not want to consider those kids—i.e. Cb et al.—part of our state when we go to call uAddUnum on NC’s parent-to-be, since we haven’t gotten confirmation (via uFlushAck) that the Cbfrozenchildtree kids have made it in to NC.  So we would pass NCfrozenchildtree to uAddUnum.  But this is not the scenario we’re evaluating here….</LI>

<I>Commentary: As of now, we are all wired up to our parent.  If we moved roots, though, we still have to start propagating the root-changed notification downwards, via our *fsupCb facets.  Note that if any of our children are in transit, the root-change message will queue in their facet; and if they go somewhere else, the root-change message will bounce, which is Just Fine.</I> <BR>

<I>Commentary: It is assumed here that OCkeyCb is the key for Cb’s branch in ORchildtree, not just in OCchildtree.  That is, OCkeyCb is a meaningful key for everyone with a tree containing Cb’s branch.  This has no security implications since just possessing OCkeyCb is not enough to spoof a request-from-Cb to OC or anyone else.  Spoofing OCkeyCb for purposes of &quot;is this the same branch&quot; is still a <B>SEMI-OPEN ISSUE</B>.  ANOTHER semi-open issue is when do you revoke the root facets ORfrootsupCb and ORfrootsupCbchild?  You want to revoke them only when you have not readded the children elsewhere in the root.  This is not critical for correctness though… the likely story will be to check whether the children are <U>already</U> elsewhere in the root and if so don’t revoke, otherwise, do.  This will work because we always causalitywise add before we remove.</LI>

<I>Commentary:  The idea here is that we continue propagating uSetRoots downwards towards our children, passing each one the sub-branch of distributors that it and its kids need to forward.  Hopefully I don’t need to spell out that Cbchild will do the same thing as Cb; it will set its Cbchildroot to NRfrootsupCbchild, it will forward &amp;Cbchildchannel to the new unum router it makes for itself, etc.</LI></OL>

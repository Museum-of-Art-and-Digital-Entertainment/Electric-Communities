<H1>The Entry And Exit Pad Ingredients</H1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This design note explains the entry and exit pad ingredients used to
implement portals and teleport pads in Microcosm.  It describes the
design as it was at the time of the PCForum demo, in late March '97.

<h1>Overview</h1>

Entry and exit pads are the basic units from which portals and
teleport pads are built. An entry pad is a particular entrance to a
region. It knows where an avatar should appear when it uses that
entrance and also knows any animations and further movements the avatar
should make upon entering. An exit pad is a particular exit from a
region; it knows where an avatar should move in order to use the exit,
what animation the avatar should make upon leaving and what transition
(e.g. fade, scroll) should be used. An exit pad also points at an
entry pad which the departing avatar uses to enter a new region. 

<p>

Note that nearly all the information in entry pads and exit pads is local
to the region that contains them. The only exception is an exit pad's
pointer to the remote entry pad.

<p>

A portal is usually made up of two exit pads and two entry pads. Suppose
we had two regions, A and B, connected by a doorway. Region A would contain
half of the portal, i.e. one entry pad and one exit pad. The entry pad
would know the location of the doorway and would know the animation (e.g.
closing the door) to be made on entering by that doorway. The exit pad
would also know the location of the doorway and would also know the
exiting animation (opening the door) and transition (doorway transition).
The exit pad would point to the corresponding entry pad in the other
half of the portal, in region B.

<p>

A teleport pad is a very thin layer on an entry pad. It knows how
to add an avatar to a region at a particular location and how to do
the "teleport transition" i.e. fading in the region and fading in
the avatar.

<p>

Note that the exit and entry animations (including teleport fading) are
not hooked up yet.


<h1>Exit Pad Ingredient</h1>

The exit pad ingredient can act as either a client or a server. Client
exit pads are not as dumb as most clients; they do a lot of the
work. The job of the server is to maintain unum references to the
enclosing region and to the destination entry pad; clients should only
get these references when they need them (you don't want to get
presences of the region and destination entry pad just because you
have a client presence of an exit pad).

<p>

An exit pad contains the following information:
<ul>
<li>Enclosing region (server only)
<li>Destination entry pad (server only)
<li>Exit animation
<li>Exit failure animation
<li>Exit location
<li>Exit transition
</ul>

The destination entry pad can be held as either a live reference
or an EARL.

The exit pad has one method:

<p><code>
  uExit()
</code><p>

This method takes no arguments at the moment; it operates on the
"current user session" which is held in global state. This is, of
course, wrong.  <code>uExit()</code> should be given a parameter which
is a capability to the user session (probably not a capability to the
avatar as exit pads should still work if you're a observer). This
capability should give the exit pad just what it needs to do its job -
i.e. the ability to move and animate the avatar (if not in observer
mode) and the ability to transfer the avatar to a new region.

<p>

<code>uExit</code> first moves the avatar to the exit location (and it
should, at this point play the exit animation). Then it gets the
destination entry pad and enclosing region from the server (it uses
channels, so this is done optimistically). Then it calls
<code>uEnter</code> on the destination entry pad, handing in the
current enclosing region and the region transition (more on
<code>uEnter</code> later).

<p>

If all goes well the exit pad's job is now done. If <code>uEnter</code>
throws an exception, however, the transfer to the new region must have
failed. In this case the exit pad catches the exception and plays the
failure animation (well it would if it did any animating!). So, for
example, the avatar might close a door after failing to exit. The
user also needs more feedback about what failed. Currently the exit
pad rethrows some exceptions, assuming the caller will tell the user
what happened.

<h1>Entry Pad Ingredient</h1>

Like the exit pad, the entry pad ingredient can act as either client
or server. And, also like the exit pad, the main difference between
client and server is that the server maintains extra unum references
that should only be given to clients when needed.

<p>

An entry pad contains the following information:
<ul>
<li>Enclosing region (server only)
<li>Initial entry location
<li>Entry animation
<li>Final entry location
</ul>

<p>

The entry pad has one unum level operation:

<p><code>
    uEnter(kind uskRegion oldRegion, RegionTransition transition);
</code><p>

This method is often called from an exit pad, as described in the
exit pad section.

<p>

Like <code>uExit</code>, <code>uEnter</code> has an implicit argument - the
current user session, which is to be moved from the <code>oldRegion</code>
to the entry pad's region, using the given <code>transition</code>. Again
the user session is currently accessed via globals, which is horrible. It
should be accessed via a capability to the user session.

<p>

<code>uEnter</code> first gets the destination region from the server
(remember the clients don't keep this reference, to avoid presences
spreading where they're not needed). Unfortunately <code>uEnter</code>
currently uses an <code>ewhen</code> to do this; it can't use a channel
because of some coercions that happen in the container code (this will
be fixed soon). Once it has the destination region <code>uEnter</code>
constructs the composition envelope which will put the avatar at the
correct initial entry position, then it calls TOSTransferUnum to
actually do the transfer (the composition envelope is an argument
to TOSTransferUnum).

<p>

If the transfer succeeds <code>uEnter</code> calls
<code>uLocalSetRootCompositor</code> on the destination region, thus
making it the current region. It also plays the entry animation (or
would if animations were hooked up!) and moves the avatar to the final
entry position, if non null. <code>uEnter</code> also does a couple of
other nasty things at the moment: it updates a global "current region"
variable and it calls the "demo realm" code to check if the avatar has
entered a new realm.

<p>

If the transfer fails <code>uEnter</code> doesn't catch the resulting
exception; it relies on its caller to do the appropriate cleanup.

<h1>Teleport Pad Ingredient</h1>

The teleport pad is a very simple ingredient, which relies on a neighboring
entry pad ingredient to do all the hard work.

<p>

It has one operation:

<p><code>
    uTeleport();
</code><p>

which then calls <code>uEnter</code> on the neighboring entry pad, handing
in the current region (a global!) and the teleport transition.

<p>

There are currently two teleport pad unums - TeleportPad and TeleportPadLite.
TeleportPad was built as a Prop. Unfortunately Prop uses the Containable
ingredient which, by default, drags in its enclosing container (usually
a region) and all its contents. This meant that getting a client presence
of a TeleportPad dragged in the entire enclosing region. TeleportPadLite
is a simpler unum which just contains a teleport pad and entry pad, thus
avoiding the "dragging in the world" problem.

<h1>Entry, Exit And Teleport Pad Problems</h1>

<ul>
<li>The reliance on globals is clearly wrong. I think we need some way
to pass in a capability to the user session (do other people think
that's right?). One problem with this is that when a user clicks on
a portal this results in a message straight to the portal's UI ingredient.
Once you're in the portal's UI ingredient, how can you get a capability
to the user session? Maybe the avatar gave it to the enclosing region
when it entered?

<li>Teleport pad is built on a normal entry pad. This may be a problem
in the future because teleport pads and entry pads need slightly
different capabilities. The entry pad needs to animate the avatar,
while the teleport pad needs to fade in and fade out the avatar. We
could have one capability that does both or we could split them out
(in which case we might need to split entry pad into a "core entry
pad" used in both cases and separate "teleport pad" and "entry pad"
ingredients that build on the core).

<li>We need to get rid of the current region global variable. Maybe
this is a valid part of a user session object though? If not how
does the teleport pad know which region to teleport <b>from</b>?.

<li>Entry and exit pads currently have unrestricted references to
their enclosing region. They should really have references to
special entry and exit capabilities for the region. Or maybe there
should be no "exit region" capability? Should entering the new region
implicitly remove you from the old one? This would solve the problem
of how a teleport pad knows which region to remove the avatar from.

<li>We need to decide whether the entry pad, exit pad or the caller of
<code>uExit</code> displays errors to the user. I think the entry pad
(or possibly the region entry capability?) should do it, so it can be
done in one place.

<li>The <code>uLocalSetRootCompositor</code> call should probably only
be callable by the user session (its effect is to make the region
that receives it the user session's current region). This would be
easy if we were using a capability to the user session instead of
global variables.

<li>The demo realm code is bogus. But the entry pad, or more likely
the region entry capability, is probably the right place to do realm
and world tracking.

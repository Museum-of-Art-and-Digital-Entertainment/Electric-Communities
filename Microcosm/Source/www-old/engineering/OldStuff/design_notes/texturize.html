<H1>The Texture Ingredients</H1>
<font size=+1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

This design note explains the texture ingredients used to
change the texture of una in Microcosm.  It describes the
design as it was at the time of the PCForum demo, in late March '97.

<h1>Overview</h1>

There are two ingredients, Texturizer and Texturizable, each
of which has an associated ec.cosm.gui.scene.Texture object.
Texturizables can have their Textures set and Texturizers can
be told to set Texturizables' Textures to the Texturizers'.
<p>
At this point in time <b>(4/8/97)</b>, that is all there is to it:  Texturizables
don't actually do anything with their Textures as there was no mechanism a few
days before PC Forum to actually communicate to the renderer about texture
changes in presented objects.  Because of this, the Texture ingredients were
not completed; i.e. there is no mechanism for client/server relationships
for Texture ingredients.

<h1>Texturizable Ingredient</h1>

The Texturizer ingredient is of kind <b>ikTexturizable</b> and contains the following information:

<ul>

<li>Texture

</ul>

The Texturizable's Texture is an <b>ec.cosm.gui.scene.Texture</b>.  This Texture
is initialized by the Texturizable's <code>init()</code> method.


The Texturizable has two methods:

<p><code>

	init(Texture textureMap);
	<br>
	iTexturize(Texture textureMap);
	
</code><p>

<code>init</code> sets the Texturizable's initial Texture to <b>textureMap</b>.
<br>
<code>iTexturize</code> changes the Texturizable's Texture to
the passed in <b>textureMap</b>.

<p>
<h1>Texturizer Ingredient</h1>

The Texturizer ingredient is of kind <b>ikTexturizer</b> and contains the following information:

<ul>

<li>Texture

</ul>

The Texturizable's Texture is an <b>ec.cosm.gui.scene.Texture</b>.  This Texture
is initialized by the Texturizable's <code>init()</code> method.


The Texturizable has two methods:

<p><code>

	init(Texture textureMap);
	<br>
	iTexturize(kind ikTexturizable target);
	
</code><p>

<code>init</code> sets the Texturizable's initial Texture to <b>textureMap</b>.
<br>
<code>iTexturize</code> sends an <code>iTexturize()</code> message to <b>target</b>
with the Texturizer's Texture.

<p>

<h1>Texturize Problems</h1>

<ul>
<li>The final hookup between the Texturizable and the UI ingredient
to allow the actual presentation to be changed needs to be added.

<li>Any necessary client/server coding needs to be done.

<li>Currently Textures are very simple and based upon the java.awt.Colors.
These are read out of realm.txt files and <b>ec.cosm.gui.scene.Texture</b>s are generated and passed
to the <code>init()</code> methods.  We need to implement more complex ways of doing textures,
with color arrays and bit masks.

<li>It all needs to be tested.
</ul>

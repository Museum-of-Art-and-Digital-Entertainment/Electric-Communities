<H2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</H2>

<P>The ComCom <B><I>system</I></B> is intended to share "location"
information amongst ComCom users via their EC Identities (hereafter
ECIDs).  The location information will include such data as how many
(and which) ECID users are looking at a specific URL or are in a
particular Palace (room?).  This could easily be extended to include the
number of (and which) ECID users in a specified MUDD or MOO, along with
other such useful information. The ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> at its
simplest is a message fan-out mechanism for forwarding this location
information to ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B>. </P>

<P>Using a particular ECID, a ComCom <I><B>client</I></B> connects to a
ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> :  Multiple ECIDs may be possible on the
<B>client</B>'s machine, and ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B> may deal with
multiple ECIDs and  may even connect with a <I><B>server</I></B> using
more than one ECID at a time, but there is only one "connection" per
ECID.  Upon a successful connection, the <I><B>client</I></B> indicates
which sort, if any, of location information it is interested in
(<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT>)
<i>and</I> what other ECIDs have permission to receive what subsets of
the <I><B>client's</I></B> location information
(<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT>). </P>

<P>The ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> receives
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permission</B></FONT>
data from ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B>, and correlates said data into what
are, in effect, routing tables.  The <I><B>server</I></B> also receives
location information from connected <I><B>clients</I></B> and routes
this information to any <I><B>clients</I></B> which have expressed an
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT> in it, and have been granted
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permission</B></FONT> to see it.</P>

<P>The ComCom server will be a Java application consisting of several processes,
either on one machine or spread across several.  First, of course, are the
ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> processes, the ones which actually receive and
fan out location messages from ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B>.  There will also
be a ComCom <I><B>server manager</I></B>, which will keep track of the loads on
the various <I><B>servers</I></B> it knows about and assign new <I><B>clients</I></B>
to the <I><B>server</I></B> with the lowest load.  Finally, there will be a
Demographic processor, which will receive and store location information and ECIDs
for us to sell later.

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>RED</B></FONT> - location data</LI>
</UL>

<P CLEAR=right>At this point in the design, there are many "connections"
between the various processes, whether these are actual direct
connections or just knowledge of how to send messages to a specific
entity.  The <I><B>server manager</I></B> knows where all of the
<I><B>servers</I></B> are.  The various <I><B>servers</I></B> share
location, login/logout, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT> information with
each other. Also, all of the <I><B>servers</I></B> send location
information to the Demographics processor.  As the <I><B>server
manager</I></B> already knows where all of the <I><B>servers</I></B> are and
is a natural central processing point anyway, inter-<I><B>server</I></B>
messages could be routed through the <I><B>server manager</I></B>.  And,
as all <I><B>servers</I></B> are communicating with the <I><B>server
manager</I></B> anyway, they could route all of their Demographic
messages through it. For N <I><B>servers</I></B>, this eliminate
N + (N * (N-1))/2 connections (N connections to the Demographics processor
and (N * (N-1))/2 connections to the other <I><B>servers</I></B>).  Admittedly,
this would also increase the amount of message traffic through the
<I><B>server manager</I></B>.</P>

<P>As far as the demographic data goes, it could be collected locally on
the <I><B>server</I></B>'s machines (into a Local Demographic Processor
or <B>LDP</B>) and downloaded to a central point periodically. This would
eliminate the constant low-bandwidth <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT>
traffic in favor of periodic high-bandwidth dumps from the
<I><B>servers</I></B> to the central processing point: </P>

<P>The first approach with lots of connections is probably the best one as the
load on the <I><B>server manager</I></B> would be extreme, which is the point
of load balancing over multiple <I><B>servers</I></B>.  Also, the overall
amount of traffic increases with approach number two or three (according to
some rough calculations I did on the back of an envelope :-).  If we decide
that the demographic data is not really time sensitive and can be saved locally
on the <I><B>server</I></B> machines and then downloaded occasionally to a
central Demographics Processor, then the final <I><B>system</I></B> will
probably look something like this:</P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT> - What locations

	two forms: 1) pure location information such as
	<B>"http://www.communities.com"</B> or
	<B>"palace://BobsPalace.communities.com:7565"</B>, which
	are stored in tables by the <I><B>servers</I></B> attached to lists of

	2) ECID/location-type information which are pairs of ECIDs and a

	"Bob; PALACE; Alice, John, Dirk", which would mean that whenever Bob enters
	a Palace, Alice, John, and Dirk will be notified.  This particular entry
	means that Bob has given Alice, John, and Dirk permission to watch his
	Palace location and that Alice, John, and Dirk have expressed interest
	in Bob's Palace location.  This also means that Bob, Alice, John, and
	Dirk are all currently logged into the <B>system</B>, because all

<A NAME="MessageTraffic"></A>
<H4>Message Traffic in the ComCom System</H4>

<P>Important information in ComCom is transmitted over authenticated TCP
connections, while less vital data is transmitted via authenticated UDP
connections.  The initial log in sequences between <B>client</B> and
<B>manager</B> and <B>client</B> and <B>server</B> are done via TCP, both
to ensure the login to the <B>system</B> and to protect and ensure the
transmission of the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest/permission</B></FONT> data
and the <FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>secret numbers</B></FONT>.  Any time a
<B>client</B> wishes to update its
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest/permission</B></FONT> data or is
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>logging out</B></FONT>, a TCP connection is used.
The connection between the <B>manager</B> and a <B>server</B> is used to keep
track of <B>server</B> load by counting
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> messages, and so needs to be
TCP.  I am assuming at this point that the <B>servers</B> are interconnected
via TCP for transmission of important
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permission</B></FONT> data anyway, so sending
the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>location</B></FONT> data over the same connection
seems appropriate.  Whether or not whatever connections we have to a
Demographics Processor are TCP or UDP is open to debate.  If it is important
enough for us to make money off of it, then maybe TCP is best.
</P>
<P>The greatest amount of traffic is going to be generated by
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>location</B></FONT> data from the <B>clients</B>
to the <B>servers</B>, and the fanning out of such data as well as
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> messages from the
<B>servers</B> to the <B>clients</B> and this information, while interesting,
is not critical to the <B>system</B> as a whole, and will be done via UDP.  If
we occasionally lose a packet about what Palace a <B>client</B> is visiting,
it's not the end of the world.  And if the occasional <B>client</B> thinks
someone is still logged in when they actually aren't...oh well.

<P>There follows a description of the procedure of logging into the ComCom
system of federated servers and routing location information; this description
is in terms of the message traffic involved in the various transactions and
the some of the processing performed in response to the messages.</P>

<P>In this examples there is a ComCom <I><B>Server Manager</I></B>, 
<I><B>Servers</I></B> One, Two and Three, and <I><B>Clients</I></B> A through
H.  I have left out the Demographics Processor as unnecessary for this
example.  <I><B>Clients</I></B> A through G are already conected with the following
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT>,

<UL>
<LI><B>A</B> is interested in <B>H</B></LI>
<LI><B>C</B> is interested in <B>www.communities.com</B></LI>
<LI><B>F</B> is interested in <B>E</B></LI>
<LI><B>G</B> is interested in <B>H</B></LI>
<LI><B>D</B> permits <B>H</B> to see what <B>D</B> is doing</LI>
<LI><B>E</B> permits <B>F</B> to see what <B>E</B> is doing</LI>
</UL>

and <B>H</B> is about to log in with

<UL>
<LI><B>H</B> in interested in <B>D</B></LI>
<LI><B>H</B> permits <B>A</B> and <B>G</B> to see what <B>H</B> is doing</LI>
</UL>

and at this time <B>B</B>, <B>C</B> and <B>F</B> are looking at
<B>www.communities.com</B>, so <B>C</B> currently sees that there are three
ECIDs "at" that location.</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B>  The colors of the arrows on the messages in this diagram are
intended to reflect the colors indicating type of data in the architecture

<P><B>NOTE 2:</B>  I am using a simplified method of
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT> in this example: 1) An
interested party is watching for <I>all</I> activity rather than expressing

</DL>

<P>This example covers most (if not all) of the types of message traffic which
will exist in the ComCom <B>system</B>.</P>

<A NAME="Timeouts"></A>
<H4>"Connection" Timeouts and Shutdowns</H4>
<P>A <B>client</B>'s machine may crash for some reason, or they may shut it
down without sending a <B><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">logout</FONT></B> message.
This would be indistinguishable from the fact that the <B>client</B> just
hasn't changed its browser or Palace location for some time.  Because
whether or not a <B>client</B> is logged in affects load balancing and the
size of the routing tables on the <B>servers</B>, this knowledge is important
to how well the ComCom <B>system</B> runs.</P>

<P>Bob has suggested a heartbeat sort of timeout scheme for ComCom
<B>clients</B>. The <B>server</B> will keep track of the
<A HREF="#LastPing">last time a <B>client</B> "pinged"</A>, and if a
certain (user-defined) amount of time has passed, a <B><FONT
COLOR="#00FF00">logout</FONT></B> message will be circulated for that
<B>client</B> and the ECID for that <B>client</B> will be purged from
the <B>server</B>'s tables. This is to prevent the <B>server</B> from
sending large amounts of unnecessary UDP packets to someone who has, for
instance, shut down their computer for the night. </P>

<P>The occasional "ping" message from the will also be useful for notifying new
<B>clients</B> of the status of someone they are interested in.  Say Alice is
logged in to <B>server</B> A.  Bob then logs into <B>server</B> B, which has
no data for Alice because none of its <B>clients</B> are interested in her.
Bob will receive no information on Alice's login status until she changes
a location (which will cause the Bob's <B>client</B>'s "online" flag for Alice
to be set to true), or <I>until she sends out a "ping" message</I>, which
will be fanned out to interested <B>clients</B> as a "login".
</P>

<A NAME="ServerTables"></A>
<H4>Server Data Tables</H4>

<P>At this point, it appears as if a ComCom <B>server</B> will need four
tables for routing information.  The first two, informational tables used for
building the routing tables, will be indexed by ECID.  For the first table
of all of the ECIDs this <B><I>server</I></B> knows about, each
record will contain:
<OL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT></LI> - Used in correlation
	with interests from new clients of this server to update this server's
	routing tables.
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last locations</B></FONT> - Changes with new
	location message for this ECID.  (This table extends as we add more
	location types.)</LI>
	<UL>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last URL</B></FONT></LI>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last Palace</B></FONT></LI>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last "whatever"</B></FONT></LI>
	</UL>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The second is a table of this <B><I>server</I></B>'s <B><I>clients</I></B>,
and the records will contain:
<OL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT></LI> - Used in correlation
with permissions messages from other servers or from new clients of this
server to update this server's routing tables.
<LI><A NAME="LastPing">time of
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>last ping</B></FONT></A> or
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>location</B></FONT></A> update</LI> - Used by this
server to determine whether or not this client should be
<A HREF="#Timeouts">timed out</A>.
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>secret numbers</B></FONT></LI> - Used by this
server to verify the UDP messages from the client and for "encoding"
messages to the client.
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>connection address</B></FONT></LI> - Used by
this server to send UDP messages to the client.
</OL>
</P>
<P>The third, a location routing table, will be indexed by location name (probably a
String) and each record will contain:
<OL>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in this location</LI>
<LI>A <FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>count</B></FONT> of ECID's "at" this location</LI>
<LI>The <FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>message</B></FONT> to fan out when the
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>count</B></FONT> for this location changes
	<A HREF="#PlaceTracking">enough</A></LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The fourth, an ECID routing table, will be also be indexed by ECID and each
record will contain:
<OL>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in the
	<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> status of this ECID</LI>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in
	<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>URL</B></FONT> locations this ECID visits</LI>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in
	<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Palace</B></FONT> locations this ECID visits</LI>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in
	<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>"whatever"</B></FONT> locations this ECID visits</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P><B><I>Example:</I></B>  Assume there are three <B><I>servers</B></I>,
<B>One</B>, <B>Two</B> and <B>Three</B>.  Currently there are no
<B><I>clients</B></I> connected.  Bob comes along and logs into
<B>One</B>.  He tells <B>One</B> that he is interested in Alice's logins,
Ted's URLs,
Bart's logins and Palaces, "<B>www.foo.com</B>" and "<B>www.BarPalace.com:322</B>", and he gives
permission for Ted to see when he is logged on, and for Alice to see
what URLs and Palaces he visits.  He also sends his IP address and port
number for  receiving UDP packets.  <B>One</B> sends back its address
and port number, along with the secret numbers it came up with for
encoding/ decoding their future UDP conversations.  <B>One</B> stores
Bob's <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permission</B></FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>secret numbers</B></FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>connection address</B></FONT>
in its "CLIENT" table, and sets the "last contact" time, and sends
Bob's <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT> to <B>Two</B> and
<B>Three</B>, who store the info into their "KNOWN ECIDS" table, where Bob's
last location fields will be empty.  <B>One</B> also sends a "Bob has logged in"
message to the <B>server manager</B>.
<B>One</B>'s "LOCATION ROUTING" table has 2 entries,
while the "ECID ROUTING" table is empty as there's only one ECID in the system
(although Bob could actually register an interest in <I>himself</I>, if he
really wanted to).  So Bob's tables look like:

<P>Now Bob opens his browser and goes to <B>www.communities.com</B>.  This is
sent to <B>One</B> as a location message.  <B>One</B> check its "LOCATION
ROUTING" table for <B>www.communities.com</B> but finds no match, then checks
its "ECID ROUTING" table for Bob, and finds no match there either.  Bob then
enters good old BarPalace.  <B>One</B> gets this location message and finds
that Bob is interested in this location.  <B>One</B> increments BarPalace's
counter and sends a UDP message to Bob that there is 1 ECID "at"
<B>www.BarPalace.com:322</B>.  In the interim, <B>One</B> has forwarded these

<P>Now <B>One</B> goes through Ted's location interests and correlates them
with its "LOCATION TABLE" and sends a UDP message to Ted saying that there are
no ECIDs at either <B>www.foo.com</B> or <B>www.communities.com</B>.  Next
<B>One</B> checks Ted's Login, URL and Palace interests against the permissions
in its "KNOWN ECIDS" table.  <B>One</B> finds no Alice or Bart, but it does
find a Bob.  Bob has granted Ted permission to see his logins, so Ted is told
that Bob is logged in.  Ted has asked for permission on Bob's URLs and Palaces,
but Bob has not granted his permission, so Ted is not told Bob's current
locations.

<A NAME="KnownECIDTableProblem"></A>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>POSSIBLE PROBLEM:</B></FONT></I> The
"KNOWN ECID" tables on <B>all</B> of the servers are exactly the same
and contain information on <B>every</B> ECID logged into the ComCom
system, and are therefore potentially huge.  This information is needed
by all of the servers, however:  The PERMISSIONS so that the servers can
correlate them with their clients' INTERESTS to build routing tables,
and the LAST LOCATIONS so that the servers can give an accurate COUNT of
the population of specific locations to their clients, and give current
locations/login status of ECIDs.  Without the LAST LOCATION info, a
server would only be able to tell its clients how many CLIENTS ON THIS
SERVER are at a specific location.</P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>POSSIBLE SOLUTION:</B></FONT></I>
The "KNOWN ECID" tables
could be kept on the server manager.  As this information is really only
needed when a client logs in, a server could ask the manager to build the
new routing entries for the entering client and for the last locations
of ECIDs in which the entering client has interest.</P>

<H4><A NAME="LoadBalancing">Load Balancing</A></H4>

<P>The <B><I>server manager</B></I> tells <B><I>clients</B></I> which
<B><I>server</B></I> to log into based on the load on the various
<B><I>servers</B></I>.  This "load" can be determined in several ways.
The simplest is just the number of <B><I>clients</B></I> the
<B><I>server</B></I> has:  As most of the load on a <B><I>server</B></I>
is probably going to be the message fan out, the number of
<B><I>clients</B></I> determines the maximum fan out a <B><I>server</B></I>
will ever need to do for one message.  Therefore, the <B><I>server</B></I>
with the most <B><I>clients</B></I> is the most loaded.  This is a <I>very</I>
simplistic and probably fallacious approach.</P>

<P>The second method would deal with the number and length of entries in
the routing tables:  Two <B>servers</B> may have the same number of
<B>clients</B>, but one set may be much more active, and therefore the
entries in the more active <B>server</B>'s tables will be more numerous
and have longer ECID lists in them.  As an extreme example,
<B>server</B> A has 50 <B>clients</B>, only half of which care about
anything at all, and that is just what 1 other ECID is doing, and maybe
the other half are watching the traffic on <B>www.communities.com</B>.
The location routing table would have one entry with a fan out list of
25.  The ECID routing table would have 25 entries with lists of length
1.  Now say <B>server</B> B has 50 <B>clients</B> all of whom care about
what the other 49 are doing, and all are interested in 10 Web sits and
palaces.  <B>Server</B> B's location routing table has 10 entries with
lists of length 50, and its ECID routing table has 50 entries, each with
a fan out list of 49.  B is "obviously" more loaded than A, even though
they both have the same number of clients.</P>

<P>But wait, I haven't even warmed up yet.  Method 2 is not as
simplistic as 1, but it still has its problems.  Suppose that
<B>www.communities.com</B> gets a hit every second.  Server A would be
fanning out a location traffic message to 25 <B>clients</B> every second
or so.  Now suppose that the <B>clients</B> on server B never do
anything but watch, and the 10 sites they are interested in are
something like <B>www.porkbellypricesinszechuanprovince.com</B> and
<B>//PalaceGingrich.washingtonDC.gov:666</B>, which hardly get any
traffic; <B>server</B> B's fan outs will be pretty much nonexistent even
though its table entries are more numerous and longer than A's.  In this
third case, the actual traffic would need to be measured and
communicated to the <B>server manager</B> and the loads calculated over
a period of time.</P>

<P>Obviously method 1 is the simplest implementation and probably
acceptable for the short term. New messages types will be needed for 2
and 3 to communicate table and list sizes or traffic volume.  Method 2
offers a simple comparison of numbers for determining load, while method
3, the best solution for determining actual load, will require
collection of traffic statistics over time--However, the <B>server
manager</B> doesn't do very much except tell new <B>clients</B> whic
<B>server</B> to log into, so the added processing would probably not be
detrimental to its overall performance. </P>

<H4><A NAME="PlaceTracking">Place Tracking</A></H4>

<P>Place tracking is the process of letting <B><I>clients</I></B> interested
in a specific URL, Palace (or other type of location) know the current
number of ECIDs which are currently "at" the location.  When a ComCom
<B><I>client</I></B> sends a location change, its <B><I>server</I></B>
will check the <B><I>client</I></B>'s last location, decrement the count for
that location, then change the last location to the current one and increment
the counter for the new location.  The current count for both locations will
then be fanned out to any clients interested in this data.
</P>

<P>Note that this would be a bad scheme for a popular location which
could generate a tremendous amount of UDP traffic.  Say that there are
5,000 ComCom users which heve registered interest in
<B>"palace://BobsPalace.communities.com:7565"</B> with their
<B><I>server</I></B>, and that many of these users visit the place
several times a day.  Every time someone enters or leaves this Palace,
the <B><I>server</I></B> must fan out 5,000 messages.  For this reason, we
should implement a strategy for filtering fanouts based on the population "at"
locations.  It might be something like:
<UL>
<LI><B>Pop. under 50</B> - fan every entry/exit</LI>
<LI><B>Pop. 50 to 100</B> - fan when population crosses a multiple of 10</LI>
<LI><B>Pop. 100 to 1000</B> - fan when population crosses a multiple of 100</LI>
<LI><B>Pop. 1000 to 10000</B> - fan when population crosses a multiple of 1000</LI>
<LI><B>and so on...</B>
<LI><B>Pop. <I>lower</I> to <I>upper</I></B> - fan when population crosses a multiple of <B><I>lower</I></B></LI>
</UL>
</P>

this section and let <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>
(and the others) know what to add.</FONT></I></P>

<P>One of our key areas for revenue potential for ComCom is the collection of
user navigation information:  How many and what sort of people are visiting what
locations.
</P>
<P>As location messages are received by ComCom <B><I>servers</I></B> from their
<B><I>clients</I></B>, these messages will be collected in a database.  These
messages include the name of the location and the ECID of the user who went
there.  The master database(s) will probably be at a specific location(s),
and the ComCom <B><I>servers</I></B> will either route the location messages
directly to the master(s) to a local (on the same machine as the
<B><I>server</I></B>) database, which could then be periodically uploaded
to the master(s).  The database could time stamp the messages if time-related
demographics are needer.
</P>

<P>Once data has been collected in a master database, a Demographics
Processor can then analyze the data for particular locations by using
the ECIDs and asking the Directory Server for demographic profile
information about the ECIDs.  I believe that it is part of the overall
ComCom design for ComCom <B><I>clients</I></B> to send profile information
(personal, friends' and public) to the Directory Server at login time
(<A HREF="mailto:jeff@communities.com">Jeff</A>,
<A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A>?).  The master
Demographics Processor could then determine such information as <B><I>"How
many people ages 32-67 visited </I>www.barbie.com<I> in the 3rd quarter of
1999"</I></B>.</P>

<A NAME="Firewalls"></A>
<H4>Clients Behind Firewalls</H4>

<P>ComCom <B><I>clients</I></B> behind firewalls cannot receive UDP
location updates from a <B><I>server</I></B>, and in some cases cannot
send UDP packets either.  Such <B><I>clients</I></B> must communicate via
TCP for at least part of the interaction:  If UDP transmission is
allowed, the <B><I>client</I></B> can send regular UDP location messages; if
not, then these messages must be sent via TCP.
The <B><I>client</I></B> must let the <B><I>server</I></B> know its firewall
status at login so that the <B><I>server</I></B> won't bother fanning to
this <B><I>client</I></B>.</P>

<P>The existence of firewalls is one of the reasons for keeping the "last
location" data for the various ECIDs:  A <B><I>client</I></B> behind a
firewall will have to connect via TCP every <B><I>X</I></B> minutes to download
the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT> data it has requested
from the <B><I>server</I></B> which it cannot receive through the regular
UDP fan out.  The <B><I>server</I></B> can then build a message of the last
locations for all of the ECIDs in which the <B><I>client</I></B> has expressed
an interest and then send that message.
</P>

<P>If UDP transmission is not an option, the <B><I>client</I></B> will also
need to send its location messages via TCP.  This could be done as a series
of individual messages, or we could implement a "bundling" protocol for
sending several similar messages in one bunch.  The <B><I>server</I></B> must
then have the knowledge of how to break up such bundles into distinct
messages.</P>

<A NAME="Groupware"></A>
<H4>Groupware: Yet Another Product</H4>

<P>While discussing the possibliy of limiting the length of specific location
interest lists to a manageable number (say 512) to prevent huge fanouts,
<A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A> suggested a mini-server
with an ECID of it's own.  Users could buy the server, set up tables for
routing to their 600 closest friends and then register the ECID of the
mini-server with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT> with a ComCom
<B><I>server</I></B>.  Then, when the <B><I>server</I></B> receives a tagged
location message, it would send <I>one</I> message to the mini-server's
ECID address, and <I>that</I> server would be responsible for the 600 message
fanout.
</P>
<P>Whether or not this is a viable product, the concept of a user registering
a group ECID with a ComCom <B><I>server</I></B> and then doing something
group-oriented with the single message the <B><I>server</I></B> would send to
it is an interesting one...

<BR><A NAME="ComComCookies"></A><B><I>ComCom "Cookies":</I></B>
<BR>As the ComCom
server talks only with ComCom clients, it has no access to the authentication
system provided by ECID. However, the server is granting capabilities to
various clients to monitor other clients. In the background this is actually
done by ECID to ECID communication which the ComCom server knows nothing
about</P>
<P>When a Bob wishes to watch what URLs Alice is visiting, Bob's ComCom
client asks his local ECID daemon for the capability. Bob's daemon uses
Alice's ECID to talk to the appropriate daemon on the Alice's machine to
request the capability. Alice's daemon checks with Alice's ComCom client
to see if Alice has (or will) granted Bob such a capability through the
ComCom client UI (by checking boxes, probably). If she has, then Alice's
ECID daemon tells Bob's ECID daemon to go ahead. Bob's ComCom client then
tells the ComCom server that he has the capability to see what URLs Alice
is visiting.

<P>As you can see, the ComCom server knows nothing about the above transaction
and just gets some message from Bob saying "I can do this," and, as the
server communicates only with ComCom clients, there is no way it to check
with any ECID daemon for such a claim's validity. Randy's idea is for ComCom
servers to mint magic cookies for each ECID upon <FONT COLOR="#009900">first
time</FONT> connection. Thus, when Alice's ComCom client is asked by its
ECID daemon if Bob can watch URLs, it can pass back its cookie as part
of the "OK" message. This cookie will get back to Bob's ComCom client,
which can include it as part of its "I can do this" message, which the
ComCom server can then check against the cookie which it minted for Alice
in the first place.

<P><I>Option:</I> As I wrote this, it seemed there must be an easier way.
Or maybe I'm just being too simplistic. The ComCom server only talks with
ComCom clients. Fair enough. How about this: When Bob's client says "I
want to see what URLs Alice is visiting," why doesn't the server just ask
Alice's client if this is okay? If her client isn't up, the request will
have to be queued, so Bob can't do anything for now, but this is true in
the ECID to ECID scheme above too. We've already gone to the trouble of
building a secure (for some definition of the word :-) connection to both
Bob and Alice, so why won't this simpler scheme work? <I><FONT COLOR="#009900">[True,
any application can mint a capability. But ECID is the center of inter-application
traffic and is the only application that can control which applications
get which messages/capabilities. ComCom can and will make it's own capabilities
(such as the shared secret for validating the UDP traffic), but its capabilities
aren't controlled/accessible by ECID, and therefore aren't shared with
other applications. So the question is: are the monitoring capabilities
granted by ECID to ComCom 100% unique to ComCom? I think the answer is
clearly no: The first two Palace Pager Plugin capability requests I think
are potentially generic to all apps: "Can See Where You Are" and "Can Send
Telepathy To Me". These are in common with ComCom, and may be requested
by other applications, like The Palace.]</FONT></I><P>

Introduction</H2>
This document describes the ECID architecture and current software design.&nbsp;
The ECID services are intended to be generic and exstensible in order to
meet the needs of diverse client programs (e.g. the Palace, <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/OldStuff/com.com/index.html">Comcom</A>,
etc., etc).&nbsp; The core pieces of ECID are focussed on the meta operations
of secure capability exchange between unique, persistent, and reachable
identities.

<P>The specific instances of capabilities are left unspecified by the ECID
core, and this means that the secure capability exchange can be used in
a completely generic way, to meet the capability exchange needs of a variety
of clients.&nbsp; The individual capabilities themselves (e.g. telepathy,
whereis, identity tracking, tables, etc.) are a more peripheral but also
important part of ECID.&nbsp; These capabilities provide the individual
messaging/communication services needed by the clients of ECID.

<P>Below, the architecture and current implementation are described first
for the ECID core (secure capability exchange mechanisms) and then briefly
for the specific capabilities that we need to support for ComCom and the
Palace.
<H2>
Architecture and Design</H2>
You can think of traditional 'Identity' as having two basic properties:&nbsp;
<B>uniqueness</B> and <B>persistence</B>.&nbsp; Uniqueness almost defines
identity...without uniqueness identity is meaningless.&nbsp; Persistence
simply means that the uniqueness lasts forever...i.e. 'your' identity will
remain the same over time.

<P>An additional property that the net allows us to associate with identity
is that of <B>reachability</B>.&nbsp; Abstractly, reachability is the means
to communicate with a given identity.&nbsp; That is, if I have some bits
that 'define' your identity (and those bits are unique to you and persistently
unique to you), then reachability means that I can (with the aid of the
net and a comm system), arrange to communicate with you (about anything...we're
leaving unspecified what the communication consists of for now).&nbsp;
This additional property associated with net identity is extremely valuable...for
example, all of what ICQ does can be summarized as a) providing each person
with a unique and persistent identity (the UIN); and b) providing the communication
software to allow anyone with the UIN communicate with the person associated
with the UIN, via the ICQ comm/messaging system.&nbsp; Although a very
simple thing, I think ICQ has shown how powerful the notion of associating
reachability with identity can be.

<P>The ECID code reifies these notions of uniqueness, persistence, and
reachability explicitly in the form of 3 Java interfaces.&nbsp; These interfaces
are:&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ID.html">ec.id.ID</A>,
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/java/io/Serializable.html">java.io.Serializable</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ReachableID.html">ec.id.ReachableID</A>
(all classes in the ECID codebase start with ec.id, so I'll omit this from
all future class names).&nbsp; The ID interface is the primary interface
defining global uniqueness.&nbsp; This interface defines the two basic
Java equality testing methods:&nbsp; equals and hashCode.&nbsp; The meaning
of implementing the ID interface is to say:&nbsp; "this class will implement
equals and hashCode such that instances of the class will survive EQ tests".&nbsp;
That is, instances will be globally unique (not just unique within a machine)
and equals() and hashCode() will be implemented to allow equality tests
(calls to equals()) to only return true if the two instances are the same
entity (irrespective of whether the entity came from inside or outside
of a given machine).

<P>There is one class that implements the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ID.html">ID</A>
interface in the ec.id package.&nbsp; The most important instance is <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>.
These three classes implement <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ID.html">ID</A>,
and redefine equals() and hashCode() so that instances return true only
under the right conditions (the two instances refer to the same identity).&nbsp;
These classes also implement java.io.Serializable, to indicate that instances
of these classes are to be sent over the wire by copy.&nbsp; They are intended
to be given out widely (in the same way that the ICQ UIN is given out widely),
and they do not convey any authority over the ID owner at all.

<P>Note that <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>
class has a protected constructor, and uses a static 'factory' method to
create new instances of <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>s.&nbsp;
This factory method is called makeNewID().&nbsp; See <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html#makeNewID()">ECID.makeNewID()</A>
for an example.
<H4>
Reachability of IDs</H4>
The <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>
class implements the ID and Serializable interfaces, and therefore guarantee
to provide uniqueness and persistence, but what about reachability?&nbsp;
Instances of these classes don't provide any way for the 'receiver' (or
client) of the ID instance to communicate with the actual owner of the
identity.&nbsp; That's where the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ReachableID.html">ReachableID</A>
interface comes in.&nbsp; This interface is a subclass of the ID interface,
and defines the one method (<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ReachableID.html#resolveTo()">resolveTo</A>),
that allows receivers of an ReachableID instance to ask that instance for
a means to communicate with the actual underlying owner of that ID.&nbsp;
The resolveTo method uses some communication system to resolve the ID into
a proxy for the actual Identity object representing the owner of that ID.&nbsp;
The Identity proxy can then serve as a way for the client to communicate
directly with the actual Identity (synchronously or asynchronously).&nbsp;
How this resolution is done is a key aspect to 'how secure' the messaging
with the resulting proxy will be (i.e. if the resolution is spoofable,
then the subsequent messaging will be spoofable...if the resolution is
not spoofable, then the messaging will be guaranteed to be delivered 'properly').

<P>The ECID class also implements the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ReachableID.html">ReachableID</A>
interface.&nbsp; The <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/RMIID.html#resolveTo()">resolveTo</A>
method is implemented by resolving the string underneath the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>
instance to a proxy object.&nbsp; Proxy of what?&nbsp; A proxy to an <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>
instance.&nbsp; The <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>
instance represents an owner's public face to the world...i.e. it exposes
a set of methods which are available to all potential receivers of IDs.&nbsp;
For example, when a receiver of an ECID calls the resolveTo method, the
comm system will resolve the name in the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>
instance to a proxy <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>,
and the receiver will then be able to send any messages to the underlying
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>
that the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>
allows to be sent.
<H3>
P.O. Box mechanism</H3>
This is where the P.O. Box mechanism comes in.&nbsp; The only interface
exposed by the Identity class is a 'meta' interface.&nbsp; This meta interface
allows capabilities (represented as Objects) to be exchanged, and can be
used a basic, secure, bootstrapping interface for all further communication.&nbsp;
That is, if I want to (for example) send you telepathy, first I have to
ask you for the capability of sending you telepathy (because you may not
wish for me to send you telepathy at all).&nbsp; The interfaces exposed
by the Identity class are designed to allow the secure exchange of <I>arbitrary
</I>capabilities (given the security demands upon the comm system are satisfied),
and does not say anything about what those capabilities are.&nbsp; This
capability exchange mechanism is well documented already by Trevor...<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/OldStuff/design_notes/identity.html">see
nice description of the P.O. Box mechanism</A> here.&nbsp; The <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>
and <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentityOwner.html">ECIdentityOwner</A>
classes (along with the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/CapabilityRequestHandler.html">CapabilityRequestHandler</A>,
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/CapabilityReceipt.html">CapabilityReceipt</A>
and <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/CapabilityReceiptInterface.html">CapabilityReceiptInterface</A>
interfaces) are used to provide this very important <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/OldStuff/design_notes/identity.html">P.O.
Box mechanism</A>.&nbsp; This is intended to provide a secure, generic
mechanism for all identity-based capability exchange (and can serve as
a general, secure way to exchange arbitrary Java Objects by copy as well...i.e.
a general identity-based secure messaging service as well).
<H3>
Security Guarantees of the P.O. Box Mechanism</H3>
The primary security guarantee from the P.O. Box mechanism is that capability
requests/responses cannot be spoofed, and both the capability owner and
the capability requester can be assured that that is the case.&nbsp; So,
for example, from the capability owner's point of view, when a capability
request is received the owner can be assured that if they choose to deliver
the capability back to the requester (which, of course, they can always
decline to do), that the capability they provide will actually go back
to the original requester, and it won't go to someone else by accident
or by malicious intent.&nbsp; From the requester's point of view, they
can be assured that if they get a capability back in response to their
request, they can be assured that the capability was actually given to
them by the owner, and not given to them by some malicious third party.

<P>How are these assurances made?&nbsp; Well, they basically depend upon
two characteristics of the proxy comm system for their validity.&nbsp;
The proxy comm system must make two guarantees:

<P>1) Object references passed between machines must be in a globally unique
namespace.&nbsp; This is essentially just saying that the comm system must
provide 'EQ' object uniqueness...objects will only be 'EQ' if their references
are in a namespace that is global, and a global namespace implies EQ uniqueness
(e.g. URLs have this property because the namespace is global).&nbsp; The
proxy comm system also makes the guarantee that object references are globally
unique (in RMI implementation terms, unique across-process object references
are just Strings that are assigned to an object upon creation via the Naming.bind/rebind
mechanism).&nbsp; In terms of implementation, our definition of the ECRegistry
class (along with RMI's pluggable registry structure), provides this guarantee,
independent of DNS name resolution, meaning that an ECID (which just holds
the 'SturdyRef' to a remote object), will refer to some specific remote
identity, and that both the receiver of the ECID and the creator of the
ECID can depend upon that guarantee.

<P>2)&nbsp; All inter-process communication must be authenticated (and
perhaps encrypted, if prevention of line sniffing is required).&nbsp; Authentication
between processes implies that both sides can know for sure who they are
talking to (by exchange of certs or just public keys upon connection establishment).&nbsp;
This applies to all communication that is part of the proxy comm system
(i.e. both client->PLS and client->client).&nbsp; In terms of implementation,
RMI provides us the means to define for ourselves the transport-level authentication
and encryption, by defining a subclass of the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/java/net/Socket.html">java.net.Socket</A>
class, and using our definition of the Socket class in all RMI communication
by implementing our own <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/java/rmi/server/RMISocketFactory.html">RMISocketFactory</A>.&nbsp;
RMI consults the specified RMISocketFactory whenever it creates a connection
to a remote process, and we can have it use any transport-level subclass
of Socket to provide whatever authentication/encryption guarantees we wish
to make for our use of RMI.

<P>The P.O. Box mechanism depends upon these two guarantees, so that when
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>s
are exchanged between a requester/owner, both know that if the other tries
to reach the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>
underneath the given <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>,
that the comm system will resolve the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>
to the same underlying <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>.&nbsp;
The same guarantee is also important for assuring that the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/CapabilityReceipt.html">CapabilityReceipt</A>
instance (the P.O. Box instance itself), that the requester provides the
owner (in the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity.requestCapability</A>
message), and which the owner provides back to the requester (in the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity.giveCapability</A>
message), both refer to the same object.&nbsp; This way, the requester
knows that the capability delivered was actually in response to the request
(i.e. because it was delivered in the same P.O. Box).
<H3>
Capabilities</H3>
We also need to define and build a set of specific messaging capabilities.&nbsp;
These capabilities will define the kinds of messaging interactions that
can take place, and can be exchanged securely (and with other properties
such as revokability) via the P.O. Box mechanism described above.&nbsp;
The capabilities that we know we need now are:&nbsp; whereis functionality,
telepathy, perhaps buddy list management and others associated with the
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/palace/BeforeComCom.html">specific
pieces of messaging functionality needed for ComCom and the Palace</A>.&nbsp;
Given the P.O. Box mechanism and the support classes in ec.id, it is extremely
easy to build new capabilities.&nbsp; For example, there is a package called
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/capabilities/package-summary.html">ec.id.capabilities</A>
for code associated with specific capabilities (and to make a clean separation
between the ECID core code described above and the code for the individual
capability implementations).&nbsp; For example, see the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/tests/">TelepathyCapability</A>
as an example of a specific capability that we will/do now support, implemented
very simply, and provided via the P.O. Box mechanism (for the initial secure
capability exchange).&nbsp; For example, test code that shows this <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/capabilities/TelepathyCapability.html">TelepathyCapability</A>
exchange and successful use, see the classes <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/tests/TestCapabilityOwner.html">ec.id.tests.TestCapabilityOwner</A>
and <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/tests/TestCapabilityRequester.html">ec.id.tests.TestCapabilityRequester</A>,
or see the source in /ec5/src/javasrc/ec/id.
<H3>
Capability Revocation</H3>
After a capability has been granted, the owner of that capability may wish
to revoke the capability so that it can no longer be used.&nbsp; The capability
owner should have the ability to do this at any time...for example, after
they've received a nasty telepathy message, when their machine goes down,
when 1 hour goes by, etc.&nbsp; To support capability revocation, the ec.id
package provides two classes:&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/BaseCapability.html">ec.id.BaseCapability</A>,
which is a base class from which all capabilities are intended to inherit
from, and <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/RevocableCapability.html">ec.id.RevocableCapability</A>,
which is a class that allows the owner to call the revoke() method to revoke
the capability to prevent any future use.&nbsp; Any subclasses of the RevocableCapability
class will inherit this revocation behavior.&nbsp; When a subclass of RevocableCapability
calls revoke(), the capability is permanently revoked, and is no longer
usable (i.e. if receivers of the capability try to use it, they will get
runtime exceptions only).
<H3>
Capability Persistence</H3>
When a capability owner creates a new capability (subclass of BaseCapability),
and delivers that capability to a requester via the identity-based capability
exchange mechanisms, it is probable that both sides will expect that capability
to be persistent.&nbsp; So, for example, if Chip will get the capability
to telepathy with Bill Gates, and say that Chip wishes to save that capability
to disk, exit the Palace application, restart the Palace, and still have
the capability that he had before (for example, to send telepathy to Bill
Gates).&nbsp; To support this, the capability owner must agree to provide
a capability that has these properties...i.e. if the Bill Gates' machine
goes down, and then after a long boot up process he restarts his copy of
the Palace, then he will probably want to continue to make his telepathy
capability available to Chip to use in the future.

<P>To support this, there is a class (8/14/98) called <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/src/javasrc/ec/id/PersistentCapability.html">ec.id.PersistentCapability</A>,
which is a subclass of <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/RevocableCapability.html">ec.id.RevocableCapability</A>.&nbsp;
This subclass will provide support for building capabilities that are persistent
according to both the requester and the owner.&nbsp; Subclasses will be
persistafiable by both the owner and the requester, and if revived by a
requester (for example), will allow the requester to then communicate with
the remote capability without re-requesting the capability.
<H3>
ECID Relationship with the Vat</H3>
The Vat ID, in the form of a string, is an integral part of the ECID namespace.&nbsp;
That is, an ECID 'sturdy reference' (name) is made up of a) the VatID in
which it was originally created; and b) a Swiss number provided for the
object upon construction.&nbsp; This structure is required (and enforced)
by the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/registry/ECRegistry.html">ECRegistry</A>.&nbsp;
For implementation details see the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/package-summary.html">ec.id</A>
package documentation/source and the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/registry/package-summary.html">ec.registry</A>
package documentation and source.
<H2>
Current Implementation</H2>
Current implentation is in the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/package-summary.html">ec.id</A>
package, with support from the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/registry/package-summary.html">ec.registry</A>
package.
<H3>
Testing and Debugging</H3>
Testing is underway.&nbsp; Test plan and existing test data are available
from <A HREF="mailto:jeremy@communities.com">Jeremy</A>.&nbsp; Test programs
exist in <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/tests/TestCapabilityOwner.html">ec.id.tests.TestCapabilityOwner</A>,
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/tests/TestCapabilityRequester.html">ec.id.tests.TestCapabilityRequester</A>,
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/tests/QAOwner.html">ec.id.tests.QAOwner</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/tests/QARequesterOwner.html">ec.id.tests.QARequester</A>.&nbsp;
For the ECRegistry, there is a test program in <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/registry/test/TestRegistry.html">ec.registry.test.TestRegistry</A>.
<H3>
Performance</H3>
Performance data gathering is underway.&nbsp; See <A HREF="mailto:jeremy@communities.com">Jeremy</A>
for existing data.&nbsp; Architecturally speaking, there is no native code,
very little java code in general, and no looping within the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/package-summary.html">ec.id</A>
package at all.
<H3>
Exception Handling</H3>
See the exception descriptions for the methods in <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECIdentity.html">ECIdentity</A>,
<A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/ECID.html">ECID</A>,
and the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/id/BaseCapability.html">BaseCapability
</A>classes.
<H3>
Off The Shelf Alternatives</H3>
The use of <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/index.html">RMI</A>
as the proxy comm layer is an off-the-shelf alternative.&nbsp; Other possible
candidates for the proxy comm system are <A HREF="http://www.objectspace.com">Objectspace's
Voyager</A> product, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">DCOM</A>.&nbsp;
I know of no existing alternative for the secure capabilities exchange
mechanism and for the <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/ec5/src/javasrc/ec/id/package-summary.html">ec.id</A>
package.
<H3>
Interactions and Dependencies with Other Subsystems</H3>
The main dependency and interaction is with the proxy comm layer of our
system, which is now provided by Javasoft's RMI.&nbsp; It also will interact
with the Palace-specific ECICCapabilityManager, and with <A HREF="mailto:sidney@communities.com">Sidney's</A>
ECID <A HREF="ECIDIACM.html">Inter-Application Communication Module</A>.

Introduction</H2>

<P>The ComCom <B><I>system</I></B> is intended to share "location"
information amongst ComCom users via their EC Identities (hereafter
ECIDs).  The location information will include such data as how many
(and which) ECID users are looking at a specific URL or are in a
particular Palace (room?).  This could easily be extended to include the
number of (and which) ECID users in a specified MUDD or MOO, along with
other such useful information. The ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> at its
simplest is a message fan-out mechanism for forwarding this location
information to ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B>. </P>

<P>Using a particular ECID, a ComCom <I><B>client</I></B> connects to a
ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> :  Multiple ECIDs may be possible on the
<B>client</B>'s machine, and ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B> may deal with
multiple ECIDs and  may even connect with a <I><B>server</I></B> using
more than one ECID at a time, but there is only one "connection" per
ECID.  Upon a successful connection, the <I><B>client</I></B> indicates
which sort, if any, of location information it is interested in
(<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT>)
<i>and</I> what other ECIDs have permission to receive what subsets of
the <I><B>client's</I></B> location information
(<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT>). </P>

<P>The ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> receives
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permission</B></FONT>
data from ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B>, and correlates said data into what
are, in effect, routing tables.  The <I><B>server</I></B> also receives
location information from connected <I><B>clients</I></B> and routes
this information to any <I><B>clients</I></B> which have expressed an
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT> in it, and have been granted
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permission</B></FONT> to see it.</P>

<P>The ComCom server will be a Java application consisting of several processes,
either on one machine or spread across several.  First, of course, are the
ComCom <I><B>server</I></B> processes, the ones which actually receive and
fan out location messages from ComCom <I><B>clients</I></B>.  There will also
be a ComCom <I><B>server manager</I></B>, which will keep track of the loads on
the various <I><B>servers</I></B> it knows about and assign new <I><B>clients</I></B>
to the <I><B>server</I></B> with the lowest load.  Finally, there will be a
Demographic processor, which will receive and store location information and ECIDs
for us to sell later.

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>RED</B></FONT> - location data</LI>
</UL>

<P CLEAR=right>At this point in the design, there are many "connections"
between the various processes, whether these are actual direct
connections or just knowledge of how to send messages to a specific
entity.  The <I><B>server manager</I></B> knows where all of the
<I><B>servers</I></B> are.  The various <I><B>servers</I></B> share
location, login/logout, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT> information with
each other. Also, all of the <I><B>servers</I></B> send location
information to the Demographics processor.  As the <I><B>server
manager</I></B> already knows where all of the <I><B>servers</I></B> are and
is a natural central processing point anyway, inter-<I><B>server</I></B>
messages could be routed through the <I><B>server manager</I></B>.  And,
as all <I><B>servers</I></B> are communicating with the <I><B>server
manager</I></B> anyway, they could route all of their Demographic
messages through it. For N <I><B>servers</I></B>, this eliminate
N + (N * (N-1))/2 connections (N connections to the Demographics processor
and (N * (N-1))/2 connections to the other <I><B>servers</I></B>).  Admittedly,
this would also increase the amount of message traffic through the
<I><B>server manager</I></B>.</P>

<P>As far as the demographic data goes, it could be collected locally on
the <I><B>server</I></B>'s machines (into a Local Demographic Processor
or <B>LDP</B>) and downloaded to a central point periodically. This would
eliminate the constant low-bandwidth <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT>
traffic in favor of periodic high-bandwidth dumps from the
<I><B>servers</I></B> to the central processing point: </P>

<P>The first approach with lots of connections is probably the best one as the
load on the <I><B>server manager</I></B> would be extreme, which is the point
of load balancing over multiple <I><B>servers</I></B>.  Also, the overall
amount of traffic increases with approach number two or three (according to
some rough calculations I did on the back of an envelope :-).</P>

<H4>Types of Data</H4>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login</B></FONT> - When a
	<I><B>client</I></B> logs into the ComCom <I><B>system</I></B>.  This
	information is used by the <I><B>server manager</I></B> to balance the
	loads on the <I><B>servers</I></B> and is fanned out by
	<I><B>servers</I></B> to <I><B>clients</I></B> who are interested in when
	certain ECIDs enter the <I><B>system</I></B>.</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>logout</B></FONT> - When a <I><B>client</I></B>
	logs  out of the ComCom <I><B>system</I></B>.  This information is used
	by the <I><B>server manager</I></B> to balance the loads on the
	<I><B>servers</I></B> and is fanned out by <I><B>servers</I></B> to
	<I><B>clients</I></B> who are interested in when certain ECIDs leave the
	<I><B>system</I></B>.</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest</B></FONT> - What locations
	and ECIDs a <I><B>client</I></B> wants to watch.  This information comes in
	two forms: 1) pure location information such as
	<B>"http://www.communities.com"</B> or
	<B>"palace://BobsPalace.communities.com:7565"</B>, which
	are stored in tables by the <I><B>servers</I></B> attached to lists of
	ECIDs which are interested in how many ECIDs are "at" those locations, and
	2) ECID/location-type information which are pairs of ECIDs and a
	<I>type</I> of location (URL, Palace or whatever), which are indicate that
	the sending ECID is interested in what URL or Palace another ECID is
	currently visiting.
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permission</B></FONT> - What ECIDs are allowed
	to watch what sort of information about this <I><B>client</I></B>.  There
	are 2 types of information, 1) login/logout or "online", and
	2) location-type (ComCom, URL, Palace or whatever).  Thus a <B>client</B>
	can say "Bob can see when I'm logged into ComCom and what Palace I am in"
	and "Alice can see what URL I'm browsing".</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest/permission pairs</B></FONT> - The
	correlation between ECID/location-type interest pairs and
	ECID/location-type permission pairs.  <B>Servers</B> match up these
	two sets of pairs to build routing tables which contain ECIDs,
	location-types and ECID lists.  For example, one entry might be
	"Bob; PALACE; Alice, John, Dirk", which would mean that whenever Bob enters
	a Palace, Alice, John, and Dirk will be notified.  This particular entry
	means that Bob has given Alice, John, and Dirk permission to watch his
	Palace location and that Alice, John, and Dirk have expressed interest
	in Bob's Palace location.  This also means that Bob, Alice, John, and
	Dirk are all currently logged into the <B>system</B>, because all
	mentions of specific ECIDs in the tables are removed when that ECID logs
	out.  If John logs out, the entry will become "Bob; Palace; Alice, Dirk",
	and if Bob logs out, the entire entry will be deleted.</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>location</B></FONT> - The type of location
	and the location where an ECID currently "is".  This information is sent
	by <I><B>clients</I></B> to <I><B>servers</I></B>, which then fan it out
	to interested and permitted <I><B>clients</I></B>.  This information is
	also sent to the Demographic Processor.  This data will be something like
	"Bob"+"URL"+"http://www.communities.com" or
	"Alice"+"PALACE"+"palace://BobsPalace.communities.com:756".</LI>

<A NAME="MessageTraffic"></A>
<H4>Message Traffic in the ComCom System</H4>

<P>Important information in ComCom is transmitted over authenticated TCP
connections, while less vital data is transmitted via authenticated UDP
connections.  The initial log in sequences between <B>client</B> and
<B>manager</B> and <B>client</B> and <B>server</B> are done via TCP, both
to ensure the login to the <B>system</B> and to protect and ensure the
transmission of the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest/permission</B></FONT> data
and the <FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>secret numbers</B></FONT>.  Any time a
<B>client</B> wishes to update its
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest/permission</B></FONT> data or is
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>logging out</B></FONT>, a TCP connection is used.
The connection between the <B>manager</B> and a <B>server</B> is used to keep
track of <B>server</B> load by counting
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> messages, and so needs to be
TCP.  I am assuming at this point that the <B>servers</B> are interconnected
via TCP for transmission of important
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interest/permission</B></FONT> data anyway, so sending
the <FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> and
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>location</B></FONT> data over the same connection
seems appropriate.  Whether or not whatever connections we have to a
Demographics Processor are TCP or UDP is open to debate.  If its important
enough for us to make money off of it, then maybe TCP is best.
</P>
<P>The greatest amount of traffic is going to be generated by
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>location</B></FONT> data from the <B>clients</B>
to the <B>servers</B>, and the fanning out of such data as well as
<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> messages from the
<B>servers</B> to the <B>clients</B> and this information, while interesting,
is not critical to the <B>system</B> as a whole, and will be done via UDP.  If
we occasionally lose a packet about what Palace a <B>client</B> is visiting,
it's not the end of the world.  And if the occasional <B>client</B> thinks
someone is still logged in when they actually aren't...oh well.

</DL>

<P>This example covers most (if not all) of the types of message traffic which
will exist in the ComCom <B>system</B>.</P>

<A NAME="Timeouts"></A>
<H4>"Connection" Timeouts and Shutdowns</H4>
<P>A <B>client</B>'s machine may crash for some reason, or they may shut it
down without sending a <B><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">logout</FONT></B> message.
This would be indistinguishable from the fact that the <B>client</B> just
hasn't changed its browser or Palace location for some time.  Because
whether or not a <B>client</B> is logged in affects load balancing and the
size of the routing tables on the <B>servers</B>, this knowledge is important
to how well the ComCom <B>system</B> runs.</P>
<P>Bob has suggested a heartbeat sort of timeout scheme for ComCom
<B>clients</B>. The
<B>server</B> will keep track of the last time a <B>client</B> "pinged", and if
a certain (user-defined) amount of time has passed, the ECID for that
<B>client</B> will be purged from the <B>server</B>'s tables. This is to
prevent the <B>server</B> from sending large amounts of unnecessary UDP packets
to someone who has, for instance, shut down their computer for the night.  The
occasional "ping" message from the will also be useful for notifying new
<B>clients</B> of the status of someone they are interested in.  Say Alice is
logged in to <B>server</B> A.  Bob then logs into <B>server</B> B, which has
no data for Alice because none of its <B>clients</B> are interested in her.
Bob will receive no information on Alice's login status until she changes
a location (which will cause the Bob's <B>client</B>'s "online" flag for Alice
to be set to true), or <I>until she sends out a "ping" message</I>, which
will be fanned out to interested <B>clients</B> as a "login".

<A NAME="ServerTables"></A>
<H4>Server Data Tables</H4>

<P>At this point, it appears as if a ComCom <B>server</B> will need only three
tables for routing information.  The first will be indexed by ECID and each
record will contain:
<OL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interests</B></FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>permissions</B></FONT></LI>
<LI>time of <FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>last ping</B></FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last locations</B></FONT> - (extends as we add more location types)</LI>
	<UL>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last URL</B></FONT></LI>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last Palace</B></FONT></LI>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>last "whatever"</B></FONT></LI>
	</UL>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The second will be indexed by location name (probably a String) and each record
will contain:
<OL>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in this location</LI>
<LI>A <FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>count</B></FONT> of ECID's "at" this location</LI>
<LI>The <FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>message</B></FONT> to fan out when the
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>count</B></FONT> for this location changes
	enough</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The third will be also be indexed by ECID and each record will contain:
<OL>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in the
	<FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><B>login/logout</B></FONT> status of this ECID</LI>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in
	<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>URL</B></FONT> locations this ECID visits</LI>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in
	<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Palace</B></FONT> locations this ECID visits</LI>
<LI>ECIDs <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>interested</B></FONT> in

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">98/08/12 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>:
<B><I>This is no longer an issue:  <B>Clients</B> tell the <B>server</B> their
permissions over a secure connection, so the security of the connection
provides the protection that cookies were supposed to.</I></B></FONT>
<BR><A NAME="ComComCookies"></A><B><I>ComCom "Cookies":</I></B>
<BR>As the ComCom
server talks only with ComCom clients, it has no access to the authentication
system provided by ECID. However, the server is granting capabilities to
various clients to monitor other clients. In the background this is actually
done by ECID to ECID communication which the ComCom server knows nothing
about</P>
<P>When a Bob wishes to watch what URLs Alice is visiting, Bob's ComCom
client asks his local ECID daemon for the capability. Bob's daemon uses
Alice's ECID to talk to the appropriate daemon on the Alice's machine to
request the capability. Alice's daemon checks with Alice's ComCom client
to see if Alice has (or will) granted Bob such a capability through the
ComCom client UI (by checking boxes, probably). If she has, then Alice's
ECID daemon tells Bob's ECID daemon to go ahead. Bob's ComCom client then
tells the ComCom server that he has the capability to see what URLs Alice
is visiting.

<P>As you can see, the ComCom server knows nothing about the above transaction
and just gets some message from Bob saying "I can do this," and, as the
server communicates only with ComCom clients, there is no way it to check
with any ECID daemon for such a claim's validity. Randy's idea is for ComCom
servers to mint magic cookies for each ECID upon <FONT COLOR="#009900">first
time</FONT> connection. Thus, when Alice's ComCom client is asked by its
ECID daemon if Bob can watch URLs, it can pass back its cookie as part
of the "OK" message. This cookie will get back to Bob's ComCom client,
which can include it as part of its "I can do this" message, which the
ComCom server can then check against the cookie which it minted for Alice
in the first place.

<P><I>Option:</I> As I wrote this, it seemed there must be an easier way.
Or maybe I'm just being too simplistic. The ComCom server only talks with
ComCom clients. Fair enough. How about this: When Bob's client says "I
want to see what URLs Alice is visiting," why doesn't the server just ask
Alice's client if this is okay? If her client isn't up, the request will
have to be queued, so Bob can't do anything for now, but this is true in
the ECID to ECID scheme above too. We've already gone to the trouble of
building a secure (for some definition of the word :-) connection to both
Bob and Alice, so why won't this simpler scheme work? <I><FONT COLOR="#009900">[True,
any application can mint a capability. But ECID is the center of inter-application
traffic and is the only application that can control which applications
get which messages/capabilities. ComCom can and will make it's own capabilities
(such as the shared secret for validating the UDP traffic), but its capabilities
aren't controlled/accessible by ECID, and therefore aren't shared with
other applications. So the question is: are the monitoring capabilities
granted by ECID to ComCom 100% unique to ComCom? I think the answer is
clearly no: The first two Palace Pager Plugin capability requests I think
are potentially generic to all apps: "Can See Where You Are" and "Can Send
Telepathy To Me". These are in common with ComCom, and may be requested
by other applications, like The Palace.]</FONT></I><P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>August 17 changes in <FONT COLOR="#009900">GREEN.</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Definition of the PPP</FONT></I></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The PPP provides the following features:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Page:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The "page" feature sends a message to another user, regardless
of what Palace they are on (except Palaces run behind firewalls). It requires
that the target has been added to the sender's buddy list and that the
page capability has been allowed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Locate:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The "locate" feature returns the URL of the target's
Palace and Room Name to the sender. It requires that the target has been
added to the sender's buddy list and that the locate capabilities has been
allowed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Buddy List:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The "buddy list" provides two pieces of information.
First, you can see all the people that you can locate, page, or send a
file. Second, you can see which capabilities (page, locate) you have been
granted for each user in the list. The buddy list allows the sender to
create custom nicknames for their friends (client side nicks).</FONT>

about PPP in world</FONT></I></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Meet Bob &amp; Sue, Palace users and acquaintances. Setting:
This story is from Bob's point-of-view.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In World (Claire, Carl)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Bob is using SouthPark, his favorite Palace. A surprising
word balloon appears next to Sue's avatar. It is in <I>italics </I>noting
that it is a whisper from Sue. It reads: "<I>Sue wants to add you to the
Palace Pager Buddy List. You need to download the Palace Pager Software
from this URL: <A HREF="http://www.thepalace.com/pager.">http://www.thepalace.com/pager.</A>"</I>&nbsp;
<I><FONT COLOR="#009900">(This is the actual [Claire to revise text] message
that PPP sends as a whisper to get the ECID from the target PPP. It only
displays in a belloon if the target user doesn't have the plugin)</FONT></I>.
The URL in the is not clickable (boo, hiss), so Bob has to type it in or
select it from the log window (ack!).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Bob has a brief conversation with Sue about why the Palace
Pager is a huge benefit to him. Convinced, he heads off to the WWW site
to download the software.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="At the WWW"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">At the WWW site (Operations)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>[INSERT MARKETING BLURB HERE – describe present and future
features]</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Bob is offered two options. He can download the plug-in
alone, or download the latest version of The Palace, including the Palace
Plug-In. He should be warned that the Plug-In doesn't work with Older Clients.&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Bob downloads only the Plug-In package.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Once downloaded, he double-clicks on the icon and an Install
Shield screen appears.</FONT>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Bob reads the following text: [Repeat MARKETING BLURB here].</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The installer checks to see if Bob has a compatible version
of The Palace. If he doesn't, the installation aborts with a message that
he has to download the current, complete package.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Bob is told to shut-off any currently running software, including
The Palace.</FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Bob accepts the license agreement.</FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Bob selects the installation directory for <FONT COLOR="#009900">ECID.
The default is /Program Files/ECID. Note that the Palace Pager Plugin itself
MUST be installed in the auto-located palace plug-in subdirectory. <I>[In
the full-install story, we need to decide where to put ECID seperately
from where we put The Palace.]</I></FONT></FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=-1>This time, when The Palace starts, a small window appears.
It is an empty buddy list. There is a text string that says, "To add a
user to the buddy list, right-click on the user's avatar or type @add &lt;username>
for any user in that Palace into the log window." There is also a "help"
button, which will launch a web page if clicked.</FONT></LI>

<FONT SIZE=-1>While looking at the "find user" display, he notices that
Peggy is online in another room. While chatting up Sue face-to-face, types
into his log window, "@add Peggy." Soon after, he receives a balloon saying
"Peggy has denied your request to be added to your buddy list." This is
followed by a barrage of nasty ESPs from Peggy liberally sprinkled with
adjectives like "snake," and "worm."</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Bob types @add Sk8terGrrl – another name he saw in the "find

Palace Pager to the Rescue!!</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>So Bob decides to find out if she is online, and where. He
clicks on the "locate" button next to Sue's name (he could have typed @locate
Sue in the log window). A moment later, a word balloon appears saying "Sue
is at the Welcome Palace, in The Wheel of Cheese." (A URL for that Palace
appears if it is available).</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Bob then clicks on the "Page" button. A dialog box appears
for Bob to type in his message: "Sue, you are the only girl for me." (Alternately,
Bob could type, "@page Sue You are the only girl for me," in his log window).
<I><FONT COLOR="#009900">[There has been some concern over using @page

<h1>ComCom Directory</h1>

<p><b>Last updated:</b>  98/08/17 <a href="mailto:jeff@communities.com"><i>Jeff</i></a><i>- Original version.</i></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of the ComCom directory is to provide a mechanism
for looking up names, handles, and ECIDs. Each entry in the
directory corresponds to an ECID user. The fields, or attributes,
associated with the entry include name, email address, and other
person related info provided by the user. Using a client or web
based tool it will be possible to search the directory for
entries with specific attribute values. The ComCom directory will
be implemented using off-the-shelf LDAP directory server
software.</p>

<p>What is a directory anyhow? Essentially, a directory has the
following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Like a database where reads exceed writes by an order of
        magnitude. </li>
    <li>Contains entries where each entry may have one or more
        attributes and values associated with the attributes. </li>
    <li>Provides mechanisms for retrieving entries and attibutes
        values within entries.</li>
    <li>Provides a way to search for entries based on the value
        of one or more attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Proposed Architecture Overview</h4>

<p>The proposed plan for directory support is to use
off-the-shelf directory server software, standard protocols, and
off-the-shelf protocol implementation. The emerging Internet
Draft Standard for directory protocols is the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). There are a few client side
protocol implementations of LDAP in C and Java. </p>

<p>Netscape Directory Servers (version 3.0) will be used for the
servers, most likely running on Solaris.</p>

<p>JNDI and LDAP will be used by java applications (eg ecid) to
access directory servers.</p>

<p>Netscape Directory SDK will be used for native C/C++ client
side access on windows.</p>

<h5>LDAP</h5>

<p>LDAP is a simplification of the X.500 Directory Access
Protocol (DAP). The short story is that X.500 and DAP are
heavyweight applications and protocols built on OSI protocols.
LDAP was patterned after DAP and designed to get 90% of the DAP
functionality with 10% of the cost. </p>

<p>LDAP's directory model is based on the notion of <em>entries</em>.
An entry is a collection of required and optional <em>attributes</em>.
One of the entry's attributes is an <em>objectclass</em>
attribute which is used to provide type specification for the
entry. An attribute's is by default case-ignore-string. The
complete list of attribute types are:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>binary</li>
        <li>case exact string (case must match during
            comparisons)</li>
        <li>case ignore string (case is ignored during
            comparisons)</li>
        <li>telephone number string (like cis but blanks and
            dashes `- ' are ignored during comparisons)</li>
        <li>distinguished name</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The entry is referred to by its <em>Distinguished Name</em>,
or <em>DN</em>. The DN is made up of attributes which can be used
to refer unambigously to the entry.</p>

<p>LDAP arranges entries in a hierarchical tree structure (though
directories can just be flat; twig-like). The classic example is
to structure the directory along organizational lines, with
people at the leaf nodes of the tree. Here's the obligatory LDAP
tree diagram:</p>

<p align="center"><img
src="hierarchy.gif" width="266"
height="164"></p>

<p align="left">In the above diagram the DN for Barbara J Jensen
would be &quot;cn=Barbara J Jensen, o=U of M, c=US&quot;.</p>

<h5>LDAP versions</h5>

<p>The LDAP protocol spec has been changing. LDAPv3 is the latest
version, though its still a Draft Standard. The primary
differences of LDAPv3 over v2 are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Server referrals: a server can send a response to the
        client that informs the client of another LDAP directory
        to query, </li>
    <li>Unicode character support: allows for deploying a
        directory in languages other than english,</li>
    <li>Additional security models: LDAP over SSL, and SASL for
        authentication, </li>
    <li>Extensible schema: schema can be published and managed
        through LDAP operations, and </li>
    <li>Extensible protocol: new functionality can be added to
        the protocol without requiring a new revision.</li>
</ol>

<h5>LDAP Servers</h5>

<p>Directory servers implement LDAP to allow clients to browse
and retrieve directory entries. Typically, the LDAP directory
server is designed with a &quot;backend&quot; that takes care of
the actual database access, and storing of entries in a file
based storage scheme. </p>

<p>A number of LDAP Directory Servers are available. For our
purposes, two are worth noting: 1) <a
href="http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/ldap.html">The
University of Michigan Standalone LDAP Directory Server (slapd)</a>
and 2)<a
href="http://home.netscape.com/directory/v3.0/index.html">
Netscape's Directory Server 3.0</a>. Netscape's directory server
is actually based on the UMich code, and in fact three of the
original UMich slapd developers are working on the Netscape
product. </p>

<p>The UMich package is LDAPv2, is free, and runs on a variety of
Unix platforms. There has been some work to port it to NT, but
this work appears to be incomplete. The Netscape Directory Server
is LDAPv3, costs $995, and runs on Unix and NT.</p>

<p>I won't attempt to give a complete presentation here of LDAP,
LDAP servers, and clients. Instead, the reader is directed to the
following sites:</p>

    <li><a href="rfc/rfc1777.txt">RFC-1777 Lightweight Directory
        Access Protocol</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We will use Netscape's Directory Server mainly because it is a
supported product.</p>

<h5>LDAP and Java</h5>

<p>In the Java market, Sun has provided the Java Naming and
Directory Interface (JNDI). JDNI is a generalized API for
directory-operation semantics. The architecture of JNDI supports
several &quot;directory&quot; protocols, one being LDAP. JNDI
supports a &quot;service provider&quot; interface enabling a
variety of &quot;provider&quot; implementations to plug directly
into the JNDI framework and work seamlessly with an application
using JNDI. The Javasoft JNDI page is at <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/index.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/index.html</a>.</p>

<h5>LDAP and E applications</h5>

<p>To support LDAP within an E application, we can use JNDI. Some
preliminary integration and testing will be neccessary to sort
this out. The JNDI api is rather straightforward. The only known
issue which will require consideration is the fact that JNDI
calls can block on network io. To solve this, we'll have to run
the JNDI operations in a seperate thread, with a queue between
the cosm code and JNDI. (This is similar to how the JDBC support
was integrated.)</p>

<p>Any wrapping of JNDI will be done in a generic way to support
multiple directories easily. </p>

<p>Attribute and objectclass specification are specific to the
actual directory. Configuration files on the LDAP server are used
to specify attributes and objectcalsses.</p>

<h5>LDAP client and server performance</h5>

<p><em>(Note here about tests published on the web that show
typical response data for loaded ldap servers.)</em></p>

<p>We need to run some tests to find out how the Netscape
Directory server performs.</p>

<h5>LDAP server scaling model (referal and replication)</h5>

<p>For our application we need to be able to support a large
number of clients quering and browsing a directory. The design of
LDAP allows for this through the use of master and slave servers,
where data at the master is replicated to the slaves. Reads can
take place from the master and slave servers, but writes can only
be done on the master. When a slave gets a write (modify)
request, the slave refers the client to the master server.
Finally, any writes to the master are replicated to the slaves
through the use of an LDAP based replication mechanism. The
following diagram shows the LDAP master/slave model. </p>

<p align="center"><img
src="replicate.gif" width="542"
height="336"></p>

<p>Referrals are not directly supported in LDAPv2. UMich
implements a referral mechanism by overloading LDAP's error
handling mechanism. This style of referrals needs to be tested
with the Javasoft LDAP implementation.</p>

<h5>ECID/ComCom Directory integration</h5>

<p>The following diagram shows the relationships between the
ECID, ComCom, and LDAP directory components.</p>

<p><img src="comcomdir.gif" width="592" height="307"></p>

<h5>Directory Access Scenario: Creating an initial entry for an
ECID</h5>

<ol>
    <li>When an ECID _identity_ is first generated on a client
        machine, the identity is registered with the ComCom LDAP
        directory. This is done by the client ECID sending a
        &quot;register&quot; message to the ComCom Directory
        Registration Server. The register message contains the
        user's ECID, and directory entry data such as the user's
        name, interests, and email address. </li>
    <li>Authentication is provided by the E connection such that
        the ComCom Directory Registration Server is assured that
        the ECID being added to the corresponds to the user's
        ECID. I.e., spoofing the ECID is prevented.</li>
    <li>The ComCom Directory Registration Server then creates and
        entry for the ECID identity in the directory server, and
        includes profile information. </li>
</ol>

<h5>Directory Access Scenario: Updating an ECID's directory entry</h5>

<ol>
    <li>If the ComCom Directory Registration Server receives a
        &quot;register&quot; message, and an entry for the ECID
        already exists, then the entry is updated. A new entry is
        not created.</li>
    <li>Authentication is provided by E to prevent others from
        updating ECID directory entries which they don't own.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Directory Access Scenario: Searching and browsing directory
entries</h5>

<ol>
    <li>Searching and browsing directory entries is provided by
        the LDAP protocol.</li>
    <li>No authentication is used.</li>
</ol>

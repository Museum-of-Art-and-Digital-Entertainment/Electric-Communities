<A NAME="ECID client"></A>ECID lightweight client <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required
for all strategies>></FONT></H3>
The ECID client software is a lightweight application that is designed
to be operational at all times. It manages user network information including
identity generation, capability granting (for contacts lists,) and reputation
aggregation (through client side certificates and non-EC identity tables.)
It mediates identity and location information with third party programs,
including web browsers, and uses EC’s secure communications library for
peer-to-peer and sever connections. A Java-based prototype for ECID is
a natural outgrowth of current development plans. See <A HREF="SampleScreens.html">sample
screens</A>.

<P>Subsystems:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;EC secure communications layer
<BR>&nbsp;EC secure identity frameworks
<BR>&nbsp;Identity certificate manager and service to applications (like
browsers)
<BR>&nbsp;Non-EC identity manager (mapping table)
<BR>&nbsp;Preferences and user interface
<BR>&nbsp;Capability manager interface
<BR>&nbsp; By-identity backlinks to capability recipients</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="Inter-application communications"></A>Inter-application communications
library <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required for all strategies>></FONT></H3>
This (small) <FONT COLOR="#009900">DLL and source library</FONT> provide
an API for applications to communicate with <A HREF="#ECID client">ECID
clients</A>. This allows applications to benefit from the secure identity
and communications frameworks without having to include all of Java. This
interfaces also include communications tools for establishing an application-specific
location model. It should be made available as C++ and Java class libraries.
<H3>
<A NAME="Palace Pager Plug-in"></A><FONT COLOR="#009900">Palace Pager Plug-in
<FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required for all the Phase I incremental release
strategy>></FONT></FONT></H3>
<FONT COLOR="#009900">This plug-in enables cross-palace messaging and buddy
location services. I communicates exclusively with ECID (via the <A HREF="#Inter-application communications">IACL</A>)
and the Palace Client (via the standard Palace Plug-in Interface). A user
can request theses capabilities of other target] palace avatars that are
online with him/her currently. The user can assign their own unique nicknames
to each target user. Once the target grants these capabilities, the user
can send text balloons to the target even if they aren't in the same palace
(example: "@page claire When you coming over?" appears in a word balloon
on Claire's machine as "ESP from Randy on SouthPark palace in Main Entrance:
When you coming over?") Likewise Randy could type @whereis claire and would
eventually see a balloon stating "Claire is on The Mansion in Harry's Bar."</FONT>
<H3>
<A NAME="PLS"></A>Process location service (PLS)&nbsp; <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required
for all strategies>></FONT></H3>
The process location service provides authenticated information about the
location of an <A HREF="#ECID client">ECID client</A> on the Internet.
This leverages EC’s current PLS plans. <STRIKE><FONT COLOR="#009900">ECID
would add the feature for people to leave capability requests and replies
on the PLS server, for delivery when the ECID Client next connects. This
is used for Contact List Requests, etc.</FONT></STRIKE> It'd also be good
if the <A HREF="#PLS">PLS</A> could provide forwarding service to get around
firewalls.

<A NAME="ECID Server"></A>ECID Server <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required only
for <A HREF="MarketingStratigiesMatrix.html">strategies
1 &amp; 2</A>, which have been all but eliminated/delayed>></FONT></H3>
Some of the ComCom scenarios mention an ECID Server. This server is only
required if the <A HREF="#ComCom">ComCom Server</A> doesn’t exist. It tracks/aggregates
location and session information, which is not distributed to end-users.
Abstractly, this is a simple logging mechanism.
<H3>
<A NAME="ComCom client"></A>ComCom “People &amp; Places” client <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required
for most strategies>></FONT></H3>
This is an important evolution of “Buddy List” applications. Besides the
usual instant messaging, chat, and group management, ComCom adds important
identity security features (by being closely linked with ECID). It also
adds new “Favorite Places List” functions: Not only can you see your friends,
you can see where they are (what web pages, what virtual worlds, etc.)
Users can also monitor traffic at favorite locations (web pages, worlds,
rooms) and click-to-connect to those communities.&nbsp; This would be new
work, all done by EC, but would NOT have the security requirements that
ECID does, so can be developed using tools other than Java. See <A HREF="SampleScreens.html">sample
screens</A>.

<P>Subsystems: (see <A HREF="ComCom/ComComClient.html">ComCom Client Spec</A>)

<H3>
<A NAME="ComCom"></A>ComCom Server <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required for most
strategies>></FONT></H3>
The ComCom Server handles <A HREF="#ComCom client">ComCom client</A> connections,
and tracks status and location information gathered from <A HREF="#ECID client">ECID</A>.
It then passes this information to ComCom clients that provide the correct
capabilities. This is all new software.

<P>Subsystems:

<H3>
<A NAME="Directory"></A>Directory Server <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required
for all strategies, may be a large part 3rd party>></FONT></H3>
The directory server is used to lookup ECIDs from text keys like name,
handle, and keyword. The <A HREF="#ECID client">ECID client</A> can register
with an arbitrary number of directory servers. Secure connections are used
for entry creation and editing.&nbsp; The directory servers should be built
out of standard components, such as LDAP servers. The connection protocol
should be standardized so that third party directory servers can be consulted
by the <A HREF="#ComCom client">ComCom client</A>.

<P>Subsystems:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;Maps arbitrary search criteria to identity information
<BR>&nbsp;Identity information may be format agnostic (the requester will
know what to do with it)
<BR>&nbsp;Add/Edit/Remove entry requires authenticated connection.
<BR>&nbsp;Expiration policy</BLOCKQUOTE>
The <A HREF="directories/directory.html">ComCom
Directory Design Document</A> describes LDAP directories and how they will
be used with ComCom and ECID.
<H3>
<A NAME="Group Server"></A>Group Proxy Server <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;optional,
may be delayed>></FONT></H3>
The group proxy server is a proposed scaling solution for point-to-group
messaging. Peer messaging is severely constrained by the number of open
connections and the speed of modems. The Group Proxy server acts as a communications
concentrator, acting as a set of hierarchical “hosts” for large group communication
(conferencing and auditorium/broadcast) functions. Though this is new software,
it isn’t a FCS requirement.

<P>Subsystems:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;Provides a multicast rendezvous point for large group
messaging
<BR>&nbsp;Can registers with <A HREF="#PLS">PLS</A> as the individual members
<BR>&nbsp;Provides moderation options (back channels and speaker control.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="DynaChat Client"></A>DynaChat client/plugin <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;optional,
may be delayed, may be 3rd party, may prototype with palace>></FONT></H3>
The DynaChat client looks like a traditional chat client. Unlike most,
it should also be able act as a small scale chat server as well (like buddy
list chat.) What makes it special is that the conversations can be dynamically
tied to a Location (such as a Web page.) EC owns The Palace, which can
be used as the DynaChat client. Third party suppliers should also be considered.

<P>Subsystems:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;Linked to web browser location
<BR>&nbsp;Local ID may be (optionally/required to be) tied to ECID</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="DynaChat Server"></A>DynaChat Server <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;optional,
may be delayed, may be 3rd party, may prototype with palace>></FONT></H3>
The DynaChat server is a standard chat server. It uses ECIDs, creates rooms
on accepts demand, and provides tracking data to the <A HREF="#ComCom">ComCom
server</A> and corporate customers. It also provides for a full set of
moderation tools. It is expected that this server will be licensed from
a third party. The Palace servers could be used to prototype this functionality.
EC will also investigate contracting operations of DynaChat servers.
<H3>
<A NAME="MetaThread Client"></A>MetaThread client/plugin <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;optional,
may be delayed, may be 3rd party>></FONT></H3>
The MetaThread client is a BBS client. What makes it special is that the
discussion threads are all location based (such as related to a web page.)
The identities of posters are ECIDs. This client should be provided by
a third party. Serious consideration should be given to using Net News
readers, esp. the ones built into browsers already.

<P>Subsystems:
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;Browsing/Marking/Reading/Posting interface.
<BR>&nbsp;Local ID may be (optionally/required to be) tied to ECID</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
<A NAME="MetaThread Server"></A>MetaThread server <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;optional,
may be delayed, may be 3rd party>></FONT></H3>
The MetaThread server is a BBS server. It accepts ECIDs for posting messages,
thereby allowing for identity reputation to evolve. Most of this server
should be provided by a third party. Serious considerations should be given
to Net News protocols/software, as it is compatible with many readers.
As with the <A HREF="#DynaChat Server">DynaChat server</A>, EC will investigate
contracting third parties for full scale operations.
<H3>
<A NAME="Certificate Service"></A>Certificate Service (for use with Client
Side Certificates) <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;optional, will be delayed, 3rd
party>></FONT></H3>
This third party component provides the full certification infrastructure
including the minting, renewal and verification of certificates. The <A HREF="#ECID client">ECID
client</A> will accept and manage certificates created by this system.
[ See the VeriSign home page for more details on <A HREF="http://www.verisign.com/client/about/index.html">Client
Side Certificates</A>. ]
<H3>
<A NAME="Advertising Server"></A>Advertising Server <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;optional,
will be delayed, 3rd party>></FONT></H3>
The advertising server provides standard (web page compatible) format advertisements.
This server uses 100% standard protocols, so many third party providers
are available. Unlike standard web browsers, the <A HREF="#ECID client">ECID
client</A> can provide session data to the advert server (not just eyeballs,
by exposure time,) so the preferred partner would be able to accept this
information.

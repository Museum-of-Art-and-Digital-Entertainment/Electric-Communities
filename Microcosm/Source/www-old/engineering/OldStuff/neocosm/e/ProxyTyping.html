Proxy Typing in New-E</H3>
<I>A topical tactical page</I>
<BR>By <A HREF="mailto:robj@communities.com">RobJ</A> 19 May 98
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>New-E has an outstanding design issue that needs to get sorted soon.&nbsp;
This page describes the situation, the issues, and the potential strategies.&nbsp;
We'll pick one once everyone's had a chance to review the situation.
<H3>
The Situation</H3>
Let's assume the following new-E-ish code:
<UL>class Argument implements Proxyable
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String myData;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Argument(String data) { myData = data; }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // warning: data better not be null! ...this becomes
important later
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void doSomething () { data.print(); }
<BR>}
<BR>...
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Argument arg = new Argument("yow");
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.send(someOtherProxy, "someMessage", arg);
<BR>...</UL>
In this code, someOtherProxy is a proxy for some object on the other side
of the wire.&nbsp; This object implements the "someMessage" method.&nbsp;
The argument to the "someMessage" method is the proxyable argument "arg".
<BR>When the "someMessage" envelope gets received by the remote machine,
the remote machine needs to create a proxy representing the "arg" object.
<BR>The question is, what kind of proxy object does that remote machine
create?&nbsp; And how does that interact with how the "someMessage" method
needs to be declared?
<H3>
Generic Proxies</H3>
The simplest sort of Proxy object is one which is strictly generic:
<UL>class Proxy {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int mySwissNumber, myRemoteRegistrarID;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int swissNumber () { return mySwissNumber;
}
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public int remoteRegistrarID() { return myRemoteRegistrarID;
}
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proxy (int id, int initialNumber) { myRemoteRegistrarID
= id; mySwissNumber = number; }
<BR>}</UL>
If this were the sort of Proxy used in the new-E comm system, then somewhere
in the E runtime (in the implementation of E.send) there would be some
code of the form (don't have a heart attack MarkM, I know there is probably
a cleaner way to do this):
<UL>if (sendTarget instanceof Proxy) {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sendEnvelopeToProxy(sendTarget, messageName, arguments);
<BR>}</UL>
So let's assume the remote machine's comm system created one of these proxy
objects to represent the received "arg" argument.
<BR>If the remote machine's "someOtherProxy" object went and did
<UL>E.send(arg, "doSomething");</UL>
somewhere in its "someMessage" method, it would call into E.send, which
would result in a network "doSomething" message getting sent--because the
E.send call, invoked on arg (an instanceof Proxy), would wind up doing
sendEnvelopeToProxy.&nbsp; (Note that at no time do we do "arg.doSomething()"
since this is E we're talking about and we know, because we pay attention,
that arg <I>might</I> be a remote object.)
<H3>
However</H3>
The question then is, what is the declaration of someMessage?
<BR>One would think it would be:
<UL>class SomeClass implements Proxyable { // or else we couldn't have
had SomeOtherProxy pointing to this
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void someMessage (Argument arg) {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.send(arg, "doSomething");
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<BR>}</UL>
Since after all, that's what it <I>must</I> be if it takes an argument
of type Argument, right?
<BR>The problem is that this doesn't work with generic proxies!&nbsp; If
the remote machine created an object of type Proxy (instead of an object
of type Argument) to represent the incoming value of "arg", then the E
runtime couldn't invoke someMessage, since the "arg" object would in fact
<I>not be of type Argument</I>.&nbsp; You would wind up needing to say
<UL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Some message or other.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * @param arg The only argument (type Argument)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void someMessage (Proxyable arg) {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.send(arg, "doSomething");
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</UL>
That way, the E runtime could still invoke the someMessage method through
CRAPI despite the fact that arg is not an Argument.&nbsp; If you wanted
to record that arg should be of type Argument, you would need to do so
in the javadoc comments.
<BR>If we captured this type info rigorously in the javadoc comments, we
could then write a tool which could type-check all of our E sends, ensuring
that the known types of the objects being sent matched the javadoc information.
<H3>
The other possibility</H3>
The alternative way to do it is to create some kind of proxy object which
has the correct type.&nbsp; You make the "arg" proxy object actually an
instanceof Argument in some way or other.&nbsp; There are two ways to do
it:
<H4>
El Cheapo (tm 1998 Arturo)</H4>
We could make it a requirement of being Proxyable that you implement a
special constructor:
<UL>class Proxyable {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected Proxy myProxy = null;
<BR>}
<BR>class Argument extends Proxyable {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String myData;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Argument(String data) { myData = data; }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Argument(Proxy proxy) { myProxy = proxy; }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void doSomething () { if (ProxyChecking.ON &amp;&amp;
myProxy == null) { data.print(); }}
<BR>}</UL>
The idea here is that the code which creates the proxy would do it like
so:
<UL>Proxy newProxy = new Proxy(informationFromTheWireAboutTheArgObject);
<BR>Object newTypedProxy = new Argument(newProxy);</UL>
This basically creates a "proxy-only" Argument object, with most of its
instance variables (except for myProxy) being null.
<BR>You could then invoke someMessage passing in newTypedProxy, and it
would work with the typed version of someMessage.
<BR>The problem would be if you tried to call newTypedProxy.doSomething()
directly; the newTypedProxy only has part of the state of the actual Argument
object, so you could die horribly.&nbsp; This is why the doSomething()
code above checks that myProxy == null before actually doing its thing;
if myProxy != null, this Argument object is actually a proxy with mostly-null
state, and would die if it actually tried to doSomething().
<BR>So if you do this, you wind up with lots of objects that have the proper
Java type information for what they ought to be, but which are huge potential
sources of null pointer exceptions if you forget to check whether they're
really proxies.
<H4>
Stub generation</H4>
The way RMI and old-E and similar systems solved this issue was by stub
generation.&nbsp; You basically ran a utility over all your Proxyable classes
and it spat out new classes automatically:
<UL>class ArgumentProxy implements Argument {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proxy myProxy;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArgumentProxy (Proxy underlyingProxy) { ... }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void doSomething () { sendToProxy(myProxy, "doSomething");
}
<BR>}</UL>
Or something like that.&nbsp; You get the idea:&nbsp; for every proxyable
class, you make a new class that has the same interface (glossing over
the fact that Argument is a class and not an interface here), and you have
its methods do the asynchronous invocation.
<BR>The problem with this is that it results in class bloat, and that it
requires an additional tool and an additional compile step.
<H3>
The Big Picture</H3>
What this really boils down to is one fundamental choice, and then one
sub-choice along each option:
<OL>
<LI>
Do we use Java declarations to describe the types of arguments that may
have come in over the wire?</LI>

<BR>If we do not, then we use Proxyable as the Java-declared type of all
arguments-that-may-be-proxies.&nbsp; In this case the two subchoices are:
<OL>
<LI>
Do we just leave it at that?</LI>

<BR>If that were all the typechecking that our compile environment attempted
to do, we would be paying no space cost and no time cost for our proxy
strategy, but we would have some risk of passing badly typed arguments
around; this could result in "bad type" errors down the line when you lose
track of what type you thought an argument was.&nbsp; The compiler would
be basically no help at all when tracking types of E message send arguments.&nbsp;
Not only that, but we would have <I>no</I> place in the code to track what
those arguments should be, and it would be hugely painful to reconstruct
that information later.
<LI>
Do we create a tool to statically check E message sends against Javadoc
type info?</LI>

<BR>If we had a (religiously used) Javadoc convention for listing the type
of a Java-typed-as-Object might-be-a-proxy argument, and if we had a static
tool that could analyze that information and typecheck the actual arguments
to E sends against it, it wouldn't matter that we didn't have the type
information in the Java declaration; the checked Javadoc, with the typechecker,
would do the job.&nbsp; (And in fact it would do an even <I>better</I>
job, because it could type-check the sends themselves!--all the discussion
we've done so far is just about the received arguments in the receiver,
not about catching type problems in E.send itself!)&nbsp; However, we don't
have such a tool, and it would take months to write one (the last estimate
was six weeks, with no real investigation of that time estimate).</OL>
If we do use Java declarations to provide type information for over-the-wire
objects, the two subchoices are:
<OL>
<LI>
Do we do El Cheapo deflectors?</LI>

<BR>They introduce a substantial risk of misbehavior at runtime, if you
get sloppy and start doing things with objects that look like your everyday
objects but are actually proxies.&nbsp; They also introduce some development
overhead in that every "real" method needs to check (for safety) that it
is not being invoked on a proxy by mistake.&nbsp; However, there is no
tool cost to doing El Cheapo; we could start doing it immediately.
<LI>
Do we build a stub generator?</LI>

<BR>This would start moving us back into the tools world, which we've already
said we want to get out of.&nbsp; (It would be substantially simpler than
a Javadoc-type-info-checking static typechecker, though!)&nbsp; One positive
of this is that it is upwards compatible with El Cheapo; we could do El
Cheapo now and build a stub generator later, and none of our (correct)
code would care.</OL>
It's also worth noting that if we keep type information in the Java declarations
(i.e. we do El Cheapo or stub generation), we could always later build
an E.send typechecker that used <I>that</I> information.</OL>
It's a gnarly problem space.&nbsp; Let me know if some or all of this sounded
totally garbled, and stay tuned for the resolution.

Running EC5 in Visual Cafe</H2>
Last updated 1998/06/30..

<P>This is just a start at real documentation. I (wsf) cribbed most of
this from <A HREF="RunningEMainInCafe.html">Running EMain in Visual Cafe</A>.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> There were some differences between 2.0 and 2.5, but only
in the format of windows and subwindows. I have included instructions for
both versions.

Get the CD or use Scott's download and install it.</LI>

<LI>
Edit the sc.ini file to add our .dlls to the PATH. See <A HREF="JohnAndTonyCafeNotes.html">Tony
and John's</A> notes for details.</LI>

<LI>
Do a <B>"cvs up -dP"</B> in <B>/ec5/src/javasrc</B>.</LI>

<LI>
Do a <B>"cvs up -dP"</B> in <B>/ec5/projects</B>.</LI>

<LI>
Start up the Symantec Cafe IDE and use 'Open Project' on the 'File' menu
to open&nbsp; '<TT>/ec5/projects/ec/neocosm.vep</TT>'</LI>

<LI>
Select the 'Project - neocosm.VEP' window and select 'Build Application'</LI>

<LI>
Select the 'Execute' menu item from the Project menu</LI>
</OL>
<B>NOTE:</B> I could not get EMain to run in the debugger. It appears
as if it does not open the little black Java window fast enough before
it also gets to java.io.FileInputStream#read(byte, int, int) which then
calls the native method readBytes(byte, int, int) and hangs.

It appears that if your main thread finishes before the threads you are
testing, it hoses the debugger big time. The work around seems to be to
set up a "wait forever" at the end of your test driver. i.e. synchronize
on an object and then call it's wait method. You will have to catch the
InterruptedException as well.</LI>

<LI>
If the compiler complains it can't open one of your .java files, open it
manually and make a trivial change (e.g. insert and delete a blank.) It
will then compile. You may have to do this procedure for every make.</LI>

<LI>
If you get a "can not write" for a .class file, check to see if NT has
a lock on it. I (wsf) got mine after some hard debugger crashes. The fix
is to reboot NT.</LI>

<LI>
Stepping over a method invocation which throws an exception does not stop.
Have fun watching your exception handling code run at full speed.</LI>

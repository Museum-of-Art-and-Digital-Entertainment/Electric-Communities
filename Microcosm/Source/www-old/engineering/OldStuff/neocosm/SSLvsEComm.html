<DT><B><FONT SIZE=+3>SSL and the E Comm System</FONT></B></DT>

<P>Last updated: [1998/05/21 Bill Frantz] </P>

<P>Author(s): <A HREF="mailto:frantz@communities.com">Bill Frantz</A>.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The E Comm system</FONT></B></P>

<P>The E Comm system currently supports one cypher suite. It is most similar
to SSL's ID_SSL_DH_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, which uses Diffie Hellman
(DH) key agreement to provide perfect forward security, the Digital Signature
Standard (DSS) to authenticate the connection, triple Data Encryption Standard
encryption operating in CBC mode (3DES_EDE_CBC) for data privacy, and SHA
for data authentication.</P>

<P>Most of the cypher suites in SSL do not provide perfect forward security.
This valuable property causes the session key which protects a communication
session to be discarded after the connection is closed. The user can not
be coerced into revealing it because all forms, encrypted or not, have
been discarded. The ID_SSL_DH_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA suite has this
property, but most SSL implementations do not support it. (It does not
appear that the <A HREF="http://www.baltimore.ie/jssl/index.html">Baltimore</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.phaos.com/">Phaos</A> commercial Java implementations
support this mode yet. See <A HREF="#Commercial Java SSL">Commercial Java
SSL packages</A>.)</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Issues:</FONT></B></P>

<P>X.509 vs. Key Centric Identity</P>

<UL>
<P>SSL supports the heiarchial X.509 view of identity. In this view, every
identity has a globally unique name, the &quot;Distinguished Name&quot;,
and there exists a heiarchy of Certificate Authorities (CAs) which bind
those names to the public/private key pairs used for authentication.</P>

<P>The E Comm system uses a very different model of identity. In this model
you are identified by your public key. You are authenticated by demonstrating
that you know the private key associated with that public key. There are
no certificate authorities or certificates.</P>

<P>To use SSL, we would have to package our keys as certificates. The Baltimore
support would allow us to override the acceptCertificate method of SSL&lt;client/server&gt;Support
to examine the key presented and accept it. However, this override would
not be compatible with the SSL specification.</P>

<P>Another hack which is probably &quot;legal&quot; SSL is as follows:
Our application is set up to accept a key pair &quot;cert&quot; as the
top level CA. We distribute both the public and private keys to that CA
as part of the application. When a vat goes to create an identity, it creates
a certificate which associates the RegistrarID (the hash of the public
key) as the X.509 destinguished name with the new public key for the identity.
When it builds a SSL connection, it passes that certificate to the other
end. We will need to add certificate checking that ensures that the distinguished
name is indeed the hash of the public key, but I suspect all implementations
will have an exit for that kind of checking. (The Baltimore implementation
does.)</P>
</UL>

<P>RSA vs. DSS.</P>

<UL>
<P>SSL was developed when RSA was the only digital signature scheme with
any degree of acceptance. Since then, DSS has received a degree of acceptance.
RSA is a patented algorthm, with &quot;mad dog&quot; patent lawyers defending
it. DSS is available for use without patent problems. That is why we use
DSS in the E comm system. My understanding from talking with Tim Oren is
that RSA licenses are only available on a &quot;unit sold&quot; basis,
and are not available for generating certificates (so Verisign can maintain
its monolopy).</P>
</UL>

<P>Client Server vs. Peer to Peer</P>

<UL>
<P>SLL is designed for Client/Server communications. The E Comm system
is designed for peer to peer communications. In the SSL model, the client
always builds connections to the server. In our model, either end can build
the connection, and we have to handle the case where both decide to do
it at about the same time. SSL has no such support. If we try to use it
for our style of communications, we would have to deal with this problem.</P>
</UL>

<P>Support for PLS.</P>

<UL>
<P>A SSL client always knows where to contact his server. It is port 443
on host foo.bar.com. The domain name foo.bar.com allows runtime lookup
of the IP address for the server. There is no way to dynamically look up
the port number.</P>

<P>The E comm system supports a way of dynamically finding not only the
IP address, but also the port number on which the other E system is listening.
This is the Process Location Server (PLS), a service which is not available
with SSL.</P>

<P>The advantage of dynamically looking up the port number is that an instance
of the E comm system can be installed without need for administrative intervention.
It also allows more than one E comm system to run on a single computer.</P>

<P>The principle disadvantage is that it makes it harder to punch a hole
through a firewall for E communications.</P>

<P>If we were to go to a fixed port number, we would need to get a assigned
port number from the Internet Assigned Name Authority. We would still need
some kind of PLS like lookup service for users who are dynamically assigned
IP addresses and domain names by their ISPs. (The PLS currently has a fixed
port assignment.)</P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="Commercial Java SSL"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Commercial Java SSL
implementation</FONT></B></P>

<P>There is a Java SSL implementation available from <A HREF="http://www.phaos.com/">Phaos
Technology</A> in New York. Their API is available with their evaluation
package.</P>

<P>The Cryptix group is working on a Java SSL package. They have not released
anything yet.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.baltimore.ie/jssl/index.html">Baltimore Technologies
SSL</A> is an example of a commercial Java SSL package. It defines two
major classes: SSLServerSocket and SSLSocket, for servers and clients respectivly.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>SSLServerSocket </FONT></B>(Client sockets are quite
similar)</P>

<P>The constructors take a port number, maximum number of unaccepted connections,
and a SSLSupportFactory which defines the SLL&nbsp;support.</P>

<P>There are two methods: accept and toString. accept returns s newly-created,
non-authenticated SSLSocket connection to a remote host. Calling any of
the accessors on the returned socket, such as getInputStream() or getOutputStream()
will initiate the authentication handshake.</P>

<P>The SSLSupportFactory provided determines all the SSL parameters. They
provide an implementation which only supports RSA for authentication.</P>

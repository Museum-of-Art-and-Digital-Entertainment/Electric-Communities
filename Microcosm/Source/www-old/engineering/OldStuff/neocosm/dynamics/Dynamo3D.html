<H2>3D Dynamo</H2>
This chunk of code is split between Java and native code. Most reports I've 
heard suggest that it bridges this native boundary in an inefficient manner, 
and that there are not clear and clean iterfaces defined.

<H3>Requirements</H3>
There seems to be fairly widespread agreement that the 3D Dynamo shouldn't be 
too tricky.

<H4>Load geometry</H4>
It needs to be able to load geometry (either by interfacing with the parser, or 
by reading a serialized object that the parser spits out.

<H4>Dynamo integration</H4>
It obviously needs to integrate with the Dynamics Engine architecture and 
support the appropriate
methods.

<H4>Renderer integration</H4>
The 3D dynamo updates the rendered much more frequently than any other piece of 
the system. It currently talks to the renderer down in native code, which may 
still be the right thing to do. There is currently a polyset data structure that 
the 3D dynamo and the renderer use to pass data back and forth. Russ said that 
this data structure was fairly arbitrary and easy to change, so if we had other
reasons for switching data structures, that might be a good idea. It seems 
wasteful to me that a lot of Kirk's code deals with his own internal data 
structure -- AgMesh -- and then converts to Polysets. It might be smart to use 
one data structure, and teach the renderer how to deal with it.

<H3>Java vs. Native</H3>
Depending on the performance characteristics of this piece, it might be worth 
considering writing it in pure Java.

<H3>Threads</H3>
Mike has suggested that we might be able to combine the DE thread with the 
renderer thread and avoid a bunch of deadlocks. This is obviously not a 
3D-specific issue, but it can't hurt to mention it here.

<HR>
<H2>VRML Parser</H2>
The current VRML parser we have was licensed through Kirk, and minimally 
supported by him. Had we known its state of incompleteness at the time, we would 
have searched for a more thorough solution, but so it goes...
<P>
The parser suffers from two big problems. It is woefully incomplete in its
node support, drastically decreasing the likelihood that we can grab any
ol'd VRML of the web and import it into our software. It also is not as
helpful as it could be in reporting parsing errors. If the parser were
more complete, this would be less of an issue.

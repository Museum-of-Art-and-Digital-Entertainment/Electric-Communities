<H2><A NAME="#ParserOverview">Parser Overview</A></H2>

The VRML parser's primary responsibility is simple: to allow us to import
3D geometry and animation data in a widely-supported and popular format.
<P>
Kirk's current parser package also includes some generic 3D library 
functionality. The current import tools rely on this code, as does the run-time 
animation engine.
<P>
We should probably make these boundaries as clean as possible, so that either 
piece could be upgraded or improved as opportunities present themselves.

<H3>Pivot boxes</H3>
Pivot boxes are small pieces of specially constructed geometry
required to make our reusable animation strategy work. Here's the deal: Our 
avatars are required to conform to a particular hierarchy, so that we can re-use 
animation data on all of them. The animation data is specified as interpolators 
that rotate body parts about their joints. One of the requirements of this 
scheme is that the joint for each body part be the *origin* of that body part. 
Unfortunately, there's no good way to enforce this when creating the avatars in 
Studio MAX (the best 3D tool we have). MAX has, internally, this exact notion-- 
it has Pivot Points for each body part, which specifies the point about which 
each body part rotates. However, when the geometry is exported to VRML, this 
information is lost. We would hope that in the VRML export, each body part would 
be adjusted so that the Pivot Point becomes the origin of that body part. Sadly, 
this is not true... So what we've done is to put a very small box at the pivot 
point, with a particular naming and coloring convention, so that the box conveys 
the pivot point information. We've talked to Kinetix about this-- they 
understand the problem, and agree that it wouldn't be too hard to fix, but don't 
particularly acknowledge it as a bug, and they aren't too motivated to fix it. I 
haven't checked with them in many months, though, so it's probably worth talking 
to them again. Another alternative would be to write a MAX plugin that could use 
the information in MAX to adjust the geometry appropriately. Can't imagine this 
would be too hard, but it's pretty specific to MAX and arguably not the best use 
of our time.

<H3>Recommended hierarchy</H3>
In theory, our particular hierarchy is not required, 
although there is still some lingering code in Kirk's parser looking for 
particular names. The only reason to enforce a particular hierarchy is to get 
reusable animation. See below.

<H3>Reusable animations</H3>
One of the neat things that does work in Kirk's code is reusable animations. 
We've got a scheme for separating animation data from the geometry it came with
and reapplying it to other pieces of geometry with the same hierarchy. This is 
probably a good idea, although we should weigh the development costs against the 
benefits. At the very least, our current scheme provides a convenient way to 
store animations separately-- I'm not exactly sure how we would attach a dozen 
animations to an avatar in a single VRML file.

<H3>Reusable animations are currently wasted</H3>
Our current reuse story is totally broken
because of the incomplete way in which 3D Appearances are serialized. 
Appearance3D's currently serialize everything they contain-- not pointers or 
dataholders, but actual copies of the objects. So each avatar that points to 14 
animations actually contains copies of all 12 animations. Totally brain dead and 
a big waste of space. I'm curious to build a repository with just a handful of 
avatars and see exactly how much space each one is taking...

<H3>Registration point boxes</H3>
Support for registration boxes used the same code that knew how to extract a 
point and a vector from the pivot boxes mentioned earlier. This allows us to 
supply registration points for avatars and objects in a 3D tool. Nothing 
particularly special about these. Kirk just already had code that could handle 
these boxes and extract the appropriate information. Substitutes would be 
welcome.

<H3>Java vs. Native</H3>
Depending on the performance characteristics of this piece, it might be worth 
considering writing it in pure Java.

<H3>Threads</H3>
Mike has suggested that we might be able to combine the DE thread with the 
renderer thread and avoid a bunch of deadlocks. This is obviously not a 
3D-specific issue, but it can't hurt to mention it here.

Below is a listing of methods and functions currently defined for Dynamo3D. Some
are written in Java and some are written in C/C++. This is meant to give a 
broad estimate of the scope of the current implementation.

<H4>Load geometry</H4>
It needs to be able to load geometry (either by interfacing with the parser, or 
by reading a serialized object that the parser spits out.

<H4>Dynamo integration</H4>
It obviously needs to integrate with the Dynamics Engine architecture and 
support the appropriate
methods.

<H4>Renderer integration</H4>
The 3D dynamo updates the rendered much more frequently than any other piece of 
the system. It currently talks to the renderer down in native code, which may 
still be the right thing to do. There is currently a polyset data structure that 
the 3D dynamo and the renderer use to pass data back and forth. Russ said that 
this data structure was fairly arbitrary and easy to change, so if we had other
reasons for switching data structures, that might be a good idea. It seems 
wasteful to me that a lot of Kirk's code deals with his own internal data 
structure -- AgMesh -- and then converts to Polysets. It might be smart to use 
one data structure, and teach the renderer how to deal with it.

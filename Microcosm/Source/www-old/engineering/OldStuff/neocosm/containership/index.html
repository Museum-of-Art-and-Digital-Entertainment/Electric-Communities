<p>
This page contains information about the re-design of containership
and the unum model. These have been the most troublesome parts of the
design of Microcosm, so we are trying to get them right for the new
Microcosm (Neocosm?).

<p>

At the moment we are collecting requirements and learning some
background information. In particular we are:
<ul>
<li> Seeing what we can learn from the existing containership code
<li> Looking at Scott Lewis' DObject work. Scott has used his IDMOO
experience, together with new ideas he's had since coming to EC, to
build a distributed object model at a similar level to Pluribus, but
with a strong session model built in from the start. This could be a
good platform for the new Microcosm.
</ul>

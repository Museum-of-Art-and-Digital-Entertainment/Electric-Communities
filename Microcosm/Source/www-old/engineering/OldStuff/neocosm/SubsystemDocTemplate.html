Subsystem Document Template</H1>
<I>This page was originally written by Trev and is now maintained by <A HREF="mailto:arturo@communities.com">Arturo</A>
with the help of <A HREF="mailto:claire@communities.com">Claire</A></I>
<BR><I>Please let me know of any errors ASAP so I can fix them.</I>

<P><B><U>Last updated:</U></B>
<BR>[98/06/11] Added items to deal with future usage:
<UL>
<LI>
Removed the (Optional) from the testing section. Every subsystem needs
to have a testing strategy. This might include tools, instructions, issues.</LI>

<LI>
Added a Performance issues section, here you will be able to add tradeoffs,
goals, things to watch out for.</LI>
</UL>
<I><B>Warning:</B> these pages change frequently. If you've looked at them
recently hit "reload" on your browser to make sure you're seeing the latest
version.</I>

<P>This template is an aid for writing our subsystem inventory documentation.
The first version of these documents are intended to capture what we have
today and it is very important that we keep them updated. The implementation
details may not be filled in but the design details should be checked in.
It's OK not to know everything to check the documentation as "what I know
now, about this subheading", as well as indicating areas that still need
documenting.

<P>These documents are stored on the internal web site as a permanent record
of our design decisions. The parts of the system that move forward will
go through the design review process started by Trev.

<P>If the subsystem in question already has documentation please see if
you can fit it in this format, as Trev reminded us having a standard format
makes the documents easier to read for everyone while avoiding having to
make a number of trivial decisions.

<P>Remember that documents are written once and read many times. Writing
a thorough, concise document is like writing good code - it will save you
and the people who use it a lot of time later on (and will make the design
inspection process much easier). Consult with Lani and Amy for help with
writing. Also, see their <A HREF="../../general/write/writetoc.htm">Documentation
Standards</A> pages.

<P>Everything below this paragraph, apart from the final link back to the
index, is part of the template. All the text in italics is to be replaced
by your (non italicized) text.

<P>Revisions to the document should be reflected in the last updated field
on top of the document and tagged comment of the form <I>[yy/mm/dd reviser].
(suggestions for other amendment marking notation welcome)</I>
<H1>
<I>Title of Document - Name of Subsystem</I></H1>
<B>Last updated:</B><I> [98/05/11 Arturo]</I>

<P><I>Author(s) List email addresses of authors. Even after a design inspection
other readers may find more bugs in</I>
<BR><I>the document and need to contact the author. Use the HTML email
tag, e.g. <A HREF="mailto:somebody@communities.com">Somebody</A>. Also
include a reference to the subsystem's original author.</I>
<H2>
Introduction</H2>
<I>The introduction should give a brief very high level overview of what
the design is for and how it fits with other components. It should be possible
for someone to read just the introduction and get a good sense of whether
they need to read the rest of the document. The introduction sets the scene,
but doesn't fill it in at all</I>
<H4>
Related Documents</H4>
<I>(Optional) list any related design documents</I>
<H2>
Requirements</H2>
<I>Listing the subsystem's initial requirements, also please add notes
on requirements that are met by the current version of the system, as well
as known not-met potential requirements, e.g. firewall support, etc.</I>
<H2>
Architecture</H2>
<I>Diagrams are strongly encouraged; a few diagrams can do wonders for
clarifying an architecture. If you don't know how to add diagrams consult
Lani and Amy.</I>
<H4>
Current Architecture Overview</H4>
<I>The introduction set the scene; this section gives the key properties
of the current design. It may mention classes and some important interfaces
but it doesn't go into details. Someone should be able to read just the
overviews of our design documents and get a good understanding of how the
system works and fits together, without knowing the full details.</I> <I>Also
include any insights gained from experience like design bugs or expense
discovered in usage.</I>
<H4>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>
<I>This section is not urgent for the first version of this document, you
should capture what direction you feel this subsystem ought to take. As
we start addressing specific systems this section will grow into the core
of the design document.</I>
<H4>
Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
<I>Any notes about potential off the shelf technologies that could be used,
and their trade-offs.</I>
<H4>
Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
<I>Lists any special objectives and assumptions of the code e.g. reusability,
thread safety, security, performance, use of resources, compatibility with
existing code etc. This section gives important context for reviewers</I>
<H2>
Current implementation</H2>
<I>This section should give details of the major classes and interfaces.</I>
<H4>
Which packages on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
<I>For example ec4/javasrc/ec/...</I>
<H4>
Implementation overview</H4>
<I>In many cases, this section can link to JavaDoc output from actual Java
classes and interfaces. This saves writing documentation twice (the designers
will have to JavaDoc their interfaces anyway). The JavaDoc should be linked
into the design document. <A HREF="../tools/javadoc.html">Chip's JavaDoc
style guidelines</A> explain how to use JavaDoc effectively.</I>
<H4>
Exception handling</H4>
<I>For any clients of the subsystem this section discusses in general the
exceptions that this subsystem can throw in usage, this section should
also link to the corresponding JavaDoc.</I>
<H4>
Examples</H4>
<I>Are there examples?</I>
<H4>
Performance</H4>
<I>Lists performance issues, targets, considerations and tradeoffs for
this subsystem. These issues can include: class bloat, runtime resource
consumption and usage/invocation cost. Here are some questions to consider:</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Is this code doing the minimum possible for TheProduct?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>Could this code be native?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>Should this code be native?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>What do you see as the most likely performance bottlenecks in this code?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>Is there another way to write them so they're not bottlenecks?</I></LI>
</UL>

<H4>
Testing Strategy and Debugging</H4>
<I>Describes the testing strategy for this subsystem. List if it is possible
to stress test this code outside TheProduct. Lists the testing API, any
tests and debugging utilities which are to be developed to help test the
design (e.g. test classes, trace categories, etc.).</I>
<H4>
Interactions and dependencies with other subsystems</H4>
<I>Describes the testing strategy for this subsystem. Lists any tests and
debugging utilities which are to be developed to help test the design (e.g.
test classes, trace categories, etc.)</I>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Design Issues</H2>

<H4>
Resolved Issues</H4>
<I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I>
<H4>
Open Issues</H4>
<I>This section of the document is used by the authors and moderator to
store any incomplete information - issues identified during a design inspection
but not yet resolved (the task list), notes that aren't ready to be put
into the main text, etc.</I>

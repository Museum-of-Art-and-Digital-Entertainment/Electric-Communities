Introduction</H2>
This document covers the lifetime and managment of unum instances in the
current version of Cosm. This is a part of the system that needs review
and simplification.

<P>Unum instances have complex lifetime. They start life as text entries
on a <A HREF="#RealmText">RealmText</A> file, then they get parsed into
a large hashtable known as UnumCreationContext, this table is fed to the
UnumFactory, which holds static references to how to instantiate every
kind of unum.

<A NAME="RealmText"></A>RealmText</H3>
RealmText is a text format for specifying data used to instantiate an Unum.

End Unum</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Region</TT>
<BR><TT>End Realm</TT>

<P>In general, a "Create" statement indicates that an object is to be instantiated
from the data that follows.&nbsp; In the case of "Create Realm" however,
this is not true, as the Realm is always created specially.

<P>A "Create" statement that appears within the scope of another "Create"
statement indicates containership, or in the case of the Realm and Regions,
the RegionContainment relationship.

<P>RealmText is parsed by the ec.cosm.tools.parser.RealmParser class.&nbsp;
If you have an UnumFactory instance, you can call
<BR>unumFactory.readUnumData(..) with either a filename or stream to retrieve
the parsed form of a RealmText file: a nested structure of Hashtables and
Vectors.&nbsp; Each Hashtable holds the data for a single object, represented
in terms of several basic types that the parser understands.&nbsp; For
example, some of the data for the "TeleportPad" object above might be:

<P><TT>Key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Value</TT>
<BR><TT>java.lang.String "name"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.lang.String&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"aztec"</TT>
<BR><TT>java.lang.String "position"&nbsp; ec.misc.graphics.Point3D [0,
0, 0]</TT>

<P>The Hashtables of data for the various objects are nested according
to containment.&nbsp; For example, in the Hashtable of data for the "Realm"
object, under the standard key "regionvector", there will be a Vector of
Hashtables of data for "Region" objects.&nbsp; The Hashtables for the Regions
in turn have a key "unumvector" that maps to a Vector of Hashtables of
data of contained Unums.

<P><B>TODO</B>: eliminate fixed Realm/Region/Container/Unum hierarchy,
change the standard keys to just "contents".
<H4>
REALMTEXT "FORGING"</H4>
The parsed result of RealmText (a Hashtable of variously typed data indexed
by java.lang.Strings) is very easy to "forge", ie construct by hand.

<P>Parsed RealmText data used for the initial creation of the AvatarBody
is forged in the ec.cosm.objects.agent.MCUnumFactory.
<H3>
Instantiation: UnumFactory &amp; UnumCreationContext</H3>
A Hashtable of data for a single object requires context information to
actually become a functioning Unum: capabilities to the Unum's immediate
container, the Unum's realm, and in the case of a portal, the other portals
in the realm it needs to link with.&nbsp; This context information becomes
the ec.cosm.objects.agent.UnumCreationContext. An UnumCreationContext is
created with a Realm Unum and various capabilities necessary during instantiation.

<P><B>TODO</B>: eliminate use of Realm Unum, replace with a capability
group

<P>An UnumCreationContext also contains a stack of ContainerContext objects
(initially empty) that represent levels of containment.&nbsp; A ContainerContext
is created with a CapabilityGroup for the container it represents.

<P><B>TODO</B>: right now a ContainerContext can also be created with just
a kind ukAddUnum facet, which is probably wrong.

<P>An UnumCreationContext is made ready for instantiation by calling
<BR>UnumCreationContext.setDataTable(Hashtable data);
<BR>with a Hashtable of data for a single Unum.&nbsp; The UnumCreationContext
provides
<BR>typed access to the data table it holds.

<P><B>TODO</B>: separate out the creation context from the data table with
typed accessors.

<P>An UnumCreationContext primed with the data for a single object can
be passed to

<P><TT>ec.cosm.objects.agent.UnumFactory.createUnum(UnumCreationContext
context);</TT>

<P>to create a single Unum.&nbsp; Note that UnumFactory is an interface
that ec.cosm.objects.agent.MCUnumFactory implements.

<P>A hierarchy of RealmText data where the top level Hashtable is the data
from the Realm object can be passed to<TT></TT>

<P><TT>UnumFactory.createContainerTree(UnumCreationContext context,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hashtable realmData,</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...);</TT><TT></TT>

<P>to create any number of objects and have them arrange themselves in
the containment relationships implied by the scoping in RealmText.&nbsp;
This method
<BR>automatically handles arbitrary levels of recursive containment under
the
<BR>Realm.

<P>The UnumFactory from the outside is a lot like the "Abstract Factory"
pattern.
<BR>On the inside, the UnumFactory is a seething pit of Pluribus workarounds
and
<BR>unrelated hacks that were attracted by existing hacks.

<P><B>TODO</B>: Whatever the replacement for RealmText, if any, the UnumFactory
should
<BR>become nothing more than a dispatch center that calls some kind of
a per-unum-
<BR>class construction code.&nbsp; The dispatch should probably be done
on classname
<BR>via class.forName().

<P><B>TODO</B>: Note that the problem being solved is construction of a
composite object,
<BR>and the current solution is to have all composite objects have a single
argument
<BR>constructor where the argument is actually an object that can be queried
for
<BR>actual arguments.&nbsp; The single argument is the UnumCreationContext
and the
<BR>"constructor"s are the functions that form the body of the UnumFactory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
TURFS, REALMS AND THE REALM UNUM</H3>


<P>From the software's standpoint, a Realm is a set of regions.&nbsp; A
Turf is a
<BR>Realm created from the Turf catalog.

<P>There is also a Realm Unum.&nbsp; There is only one Realm Unum, it is
created at
<BR>initial startup and never destroyed (like the Avatar).&nbsp; When Realms
and
<BR>Turfs are created and destroyed, various Unums within the Realm (for
example
<BR>regions and portals) register and unregister with the Realm Unum.

<P>At startup, a Realm is created.&nbsp; The regions in this Realm can
never be
<BR>destroyed, although the Inventory can be used to destroy almost all
other
<BR>objects in this initial Realm.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
THE CATALOG</H2>


<P>The Catalog is an ingredient in the avatar Unum called "AvatarCatalog".
<BR>Source is in
<BR>cosm1/object/ingredients/avatar

<P>Two presenters are used for the Catalog: the GUICatalogListPresenter
and
<BR>the GUICatalogPresenter.&nbsp; Source is in
<BR>cosm1/ui/gui/uipresenter

<P>The GUICatalogListPresenter just scans the "catalog" directory and lists
<BR>all files who's names are of the form "catalog.*.txt", and lists them.
<BR>Note there can be any number of catalogs of any type.

<P>TODO: Create a catalogIndex.txt readable by java.util.Properties, and
use
<BR>it as the list of catalogs.

<P>When the user selects a catalog to open, the Catalog uses the
<BR>UnumFactory.readUnumData methods to load RealmText files, and does
some
<BR>minor munging of the parsed RealmText to fill a CatalogData object,
which
<BR>the Catalog shares with the GUICatalogPresenter.&nbsp; The CatalogData
object
<BR>just holds the parsed form of RealmText with some intervening structural
<BR>objects that also have some information cached for the presenter and
some
<BR>information only used by the presenter.

<P>Source for the CatalogData and the structural objects mentioned above
is in
<BR>cosm1/ui/presenter/steward

<P>The GUICatalogPresenter presents the data in the RealmText file as a
list
<BR>of objects divided into "tabs".&nbsp; Tabs correspond to Create Region
statements
<BR>in RealmText, and an entire GUICatalogPresenter corresponds to the
Create
<BR>Realm scope.&nbsp; The data from the RealmText file is presented differently
<BR>according to the CatalogData object's type: swatch catalog, item catalog,
<BR>turf catalog or avatar catalog.

<P>When the user selects an item to instantiate, the Catalog leverages
the
<BR>instantiation logic in the UnumFactory to create Unums on the fly,
then
<BR>uses various capabilities over other objects to bring the new Unums
into
<BR>the world appropriately (according to type).

<P>This is done differently for each catalog type as follows:

<P>Items/Swatches
<BR>--------------
<BR>Objects are instantiated into the pocket, then moved into the avatar's
hand.
<BR>If there is a TOS failure (or other, possibly bogus failure) on the
move to
<BR>the hand, the object ends up in the avatar's pocket.

<P>TODO: Instantiate into null container, then move to hand.&nbsp; Very
very easy,
<BR>essentially just a removal of code, was implemented at one point, but
<BR>breaks the current container of last resort model, where an object's
initial
<BR>container is it's container of last resort.

<P>Avatars
<BR>-------
<BR>Although the avatar body created on a normal initial startup is actually
<BR>made from "forged" RealmText (see above), data for instantiating avatar
<BR>bodies can be specified in RealmText, and this is done for Avatar catalogs.

<P>The Avatar catalog really creates an AvatarBody Unum, not an Avatar
Unum.
<BR>The body is created into a NULL container, then swapped with the Avatar's
<BR>current body by way of an interface in AvatarBodyLink in
<BR>src/cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar
<BR>The Catalog then destroys the old avatar body.

<P>Turfs
<BR>-----
<BR>A Turf Catalog RealmText file does not actually contain data to create
Unums.
<BR>Instead, "Create Unum" statements in a Turf Catalog contain a special
key
<BR>"RealmTextFile" that is the name of another RealmText file with the
actual
<BR>data for a Turf, that is, data that when parsed can be passed to
<BR>UnumFactory.createContainerTree();

<P>If the user has previously created a Turf using the Turf Catalog, when
a new
<BR>Turf is created the previous turf is destroyed.&nbsp; Turf destruction
consists of
<BR>deleting all regions, portals, props, etc, that were created as part
of the
<BR>Turf; this can include things that the user has since moved out of
the Turf
<BR>(although a well designed turf should probably have no moveable objects),
but
<BR>will not include objects that the user created separately and moved
into her
<BR>turf.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
SWATCH IMPORT</H3>


<P>Everything happens in AvatarCatalog_ingr.plu, uImportItem()

<P>Once the user has chosen a bitmap (.bmp) to import, the catalog loads
the
<BR>bitmap from disk and does various bogosity checks on it.&nbsp; Those
bogosity
<BR>checks do not currently include a full format check, but should.

<P>The resulting byte array, if valid, is given to the PublishRepository,
which
<BR>stores it, sets it up to be externally downloadable, and returns a
DataHolder
<BR>to it (all as the result of one call).

<P>An entry in the current catalog for the Swatch is forged (see forging
<BR>RealmText above).

<P>As the swatch is created, it is actually swatched itself with the same
<BR>texture it swatches with, by applying a TextureStructure (see Robj).

<P>THE INVENTORY

<P>The Inventory is really the AvatarInventory ingredient in the Avatar
Unum.
<BR>Source is in cosm1/objects/ingredients/avatar

<P>When the UnumFactory creates an object, it sends the UnumSoul of that
object to
<BR>the Inventory.&nbsp; Since the Inventory is created after the UnumFactory,
this is
<BR>done with a channel who's distributor is given to the Inventory when
the Avatar
<BR>is instantiated.

<P>TODO: somehow make this mechanism synchronous.&nbsp; Otherwise, messages
with Unum's
<BR>being sent to the Inventory can be left undelivered if serialization
occurs
<BR>while the message is sitting in the channel.

<P>The Inventory gets the Unum for that UnumSoul and tries to get a description
for
<BR>that object from the Composition system, or failing that, the Describer
ingredient.
<BR>It stores any retrieved information in an InventoryDescription object,
and
<BR>maintains two parallel Hashtables, one of SoulStates (retrieved from
UnumSouls)
<BR>of Unums, and one of InventoryDescriptions.&nbsp; The tables are keyed
by
<BR>java.lang.Long objects, created in sequence.

<P>TODO: The Inventory ignores certain types of objects that the user shouldn't
<BR>be able to delete from the Inventory, such as Regions and the current
AvatarBody.
<BR>Really, those objects should either be kept but not displayed to the
user or
<BR>should be displayed to the user with most operations inactive.&nbsp;
If the Inventory
<BR>can gather every last object, a separate mechanism of tracking all
objects for
<BR>serialization can be eliminated (see Arturo).

<P>The table of descriptions is given to the GUIInventoryPresenter.&nbsp;
When the
<BR>GUIInventoryPresenter needs to do an operation on an Unum in the Inventory
it
<BR>refers to the Unum by it's java.lang.Long key.

<P>Remove
<BR>------
<BR>This just leverages the UnumSoul.kill() facility to completely destroy
the host
<BR>presence of an Unum.

<P>Modify
<BR>------
<BR>Sends a message to the PropertyManager's Unum-level interface to invoke
a Property
<BR>Sheet.

<P>Recover
<BR>-------
<BR>Checks if an Unum is nailed down by looking at the state bundle for
the Unum's
<BR>Portability ingredient.&nbsp; If the object is not nailed down, retrieves
a capability
<BR>to arbitrarily change the Unum's container from the CapabilityGroup
in the Unum's
<BR>SoulState, and changes the Unum's container to the Pocket.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
UNUM DELETION CLEANUP</H3>


<P>Killing an Unum means destroying the host presence of the Unum in addition
to all
<BR>clients, freeing all resources and garbage collecting all objects.

<P>TODO: No one has looked closely to my knowledge, but UnumKilling probably
doesn't
<BR>accomplish all of the above right now.

<P>You can kill an Unum if you have access to its ec.pl.runtime.UnumSoul.&nbsp;
You can
<BR>gain access to any Unum's UnumSoul if you have the ec.pl.runtime.UnumMaster
<BR>capability; then you simply call unumSoul.kill()

<P>There are two types of notification of UnumKill.&nbsp; If you are an
ingredient in an
<BR>Unum being killed, you can implement the interface ec.pl.runtime.UnumKillHandler,
<BR>which contains one method, noteUnumKilled(void), that will be called
when the Unum
<BR>is killed.

<P>If you have access to an Unum's UnumSoul, you can register to be notified
when
<BR>the Unum is deleted.&nbsp; The interface you implement is UnumKillInterest,
and the
<BR>single method in this interface is noteUnumKilled(SoulState forIdentification).

<P>Various subsystems use UnumKill notification for cleanup, although many
subsystems
<BR>don't do so and need to.

<P>When a containable is deleted, it removes itself from it's container.

<P>When a container is deleted, it ejects its contents, and the contents
wind up in
<BR>their container of last resort.

<P>When teleport pads are deleted, they unregister themselves with both
the Avatar
<BR>and the Realm.

<P>The Inventory registers interest in UnumKill notification for all Unums
it tracks,
<BR>and removes any killed Unums from its list.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>
&nbsp;
<H3>
The Catalog</H3>
-----------
<BR>Really, the Catalog should be either a database or filesystem.

<P>Users should be able to add new items to catalogs, through both external
tools
<BR>and in-world mechanisms (like swatch import).&nbsp; Users should be
able to create
<BR>their own arbitrary groupings of items, and destroy existing ones.&nbsp;
Users should
<BR>be able to merge in other user's catalogs or items, through both in-world
and
<BR>out-of-world mechanisms.

<P>There are two ways to do this: if you make the catalog a database, then
there
<BR>are a bunch of items and a bunch of heavily overlapping groupings of
items.
<BR>The same item can exist in more than one group.

<P>If you make the catalog a filesystem, then there are groupings of items
that
<BR>contain the one and only instance of those items - if you want the
same item
<BR>in two groups, you copy it.&nbsp; This is less powerful and less space
efficient, but
<BR>easier to understand than a database.&nbsp; By using tricks like only
duplicating an
<BR>item when the data for its representation in a group is edited (rather
than
<BR>when it is added to new groups) you could implement the UI as a filesystem
and
<BR>the mechanism as a database.

<P>If everything is editable by default, there will need to be a notion
of a read-only
<BR>catalog that EC or a hub might distribute.&nbsp; Read-only catalogs
would be fixed
<BR>and uneditable, and would receive regular updates that overwrite earlier
versions.
<BR>If users want to create custom versions of items in uneditable catalogs,
they can
<BR>create copies that are editable.

<P>Note that there is dormant code in the Catalog for loading RealmText
from the
<BR>Repository.&nbsp; This code was at one point the active and checked
in version, but
<BR>there are a couple of problems:
<BR>1. The cycle for testing new RealmText becomes tedious, more complicated,
and
<BR>error prone.
<BR>2. You can't get names of Catalogs for free by using names of files,
so you
<BR>have to create an additional chunk of data that acts as an index of
catalogs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Trimming the Catalog</H3>
--------------------
<BR>Once parsed RealmText data is loaded by the catalog, it is stored in
the
<BR>Catalog's state bundle and serialized.&nbsp; It could, instead, be
reloaded from
<BR>RealmText after revival the next time the user opens that catalog -
the actual
<BR>RealmText parsing time is nearly neglible next to image loading time
for most
<BR>catalogs.&nbsp; If this were done, imported swatches and any other
modifiable objects
<BR>in the catalog would require some special handling.&nbsp; Note that
since the
<BR>Catalog's data is accessed only when the Catalog is instantiating something,
<BR>this would probably not help the working set.

<P>Alternately, the Catalog could have an external storage format that
it saves
<BR>in whenever the user makes changes, and the Catalog could share that
format
<BR>with external tools (this is basically the database/filesystem suggestion
<BR>above).&nbsp; This is the right thing in the long run.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Certification</H3>
-------------
<BR>I think that the Catalog is the right place to introduce certification
to the
<BR>user, although the process is going to be more complicated than pressing
a
<BR>button to certify something.&nbsp; There will probably need to be an
entirely
<BR>separate "Certifier" class or set of classes to handle the certification
<BR>process.&nbsp; The Certifier needs to do all of:

<P>1) Teach the user about what certification means (probably by pointing
to the web)
<BR>2) Retrieve an index of Certifying agencies from somewhere and point
to web pages
<BR>for each.&nbsp; Those pages would describe the criteria on which the
agencies certify,
<BR>and explain the fees and terms, if any, for certification.
<BR>3) Submit an object for certification to some agency and be able to
notify the
<BR>user when a response is received, and associate the resulting certificate
with the
<BR>object it certifies in the Catalog's data.&nbsp; All editing tools
need to be aware of
<BR>certification as well, as certified objects or object in the middle
of being
<BR>certified should not be editable.
<BR>4) Contact remote realms and query them for their current policies.
<BR>5) Possibly have facilities for getting new certificates propagated
to various hubs,
<BR>ftp sites, etc.

<P>Note that you could do the entire certification process via the web
if you were
<BR>willing to complicate the process a bit, requiring the user to take
some kind of
<BR>"import" action on the certificate once received.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Avatars, Realms and Hubs</H3>
------------------------
<BR>At various points in the software, both the Avatar and Realm Unums
are assumed
<BR>to have full power over a process/hub/agent.&nbsp; Really, there should
be a separation of
<BR>authority where the Realm holds all capabilities over all hosted objects
and
<BR>the Avatar holds all capabilities over the UI.&nbsp; The Avatar's status
with respect
<BR>to his home Realm should be as an object that, through whatever mechanism,
<BR>has a series of closely held capabilities over the Realm.

<P>With this kind of separation it should become possible to start a Realm
without
<BR>an Avatar, and to give out admin rights to Avatars and even to adminstrative
<BR>applications that don't have an Avatar Unum (eg admin from the web).

<P>In particular this means that the Catalog and Inventory should be part
of the
<BR>Realm (and/or just be separate objects not directly accessible to the
Avatar)
<BR>that any Avatars communicate with via a facet.

Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>
<I>This section is not urgent for the first version of this document, you
should capture what direction you feel this subsystem ought to take. As
we start addressing specific systems this section will grow into the core
of the design document.</I>
<H4>
Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
<I>Any notes about potential off the shelf technologies that could be used,
and their trade-offs.</I>
<H4>
Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
<I>Lists any special objectives and assumptions of the code e.g. reusability,
thread safety, security, performance, use of resources, compatibility with
existing code etc. This section gives important context for reviewers</I>
<H2>
Current implementation</H2>
<I>This section should give details of the major classes and interfaces.</I>
<H4>
Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
<I>For example ec4/javasrc/ec/...</I>
<H4>
Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>
<I>In many cases, this section can link to JavaDoc output from actual Java
classes and interfaces. This saves writing documentation twice (the designers
will have to JavaDoc their interfaces anyway). The JavaDoc should be linked

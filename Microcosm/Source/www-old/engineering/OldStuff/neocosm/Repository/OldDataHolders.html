[98/07/13 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>] Right now this is just a
list of the major classes and interfaces, along with some
<A HREF="#ChipNotes">Chip notes</A>...

<P><A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolders</A> hold onto a
<A HREF="#CryptoHash">CryptoHash</A>, a
<A HREF="OldRepository.html#ParimeterizedRepository">ParimeterizedRepository</A> and a
<A HREF="#Fulfiller">Fulfiller</A>.  A
<A HREF="#CryptoHash">DataHolder</A> can be asked for
its held() Object, and it will,
in turn, call its <A HREF="#Fulfiller">Fulfiller's</A>
getFromRepository() method.

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<A name="CryptoHash"></A>
<H4>CryptoHash (Class)</H4>

Implements Serializable and RtStateUpgradeable.

<P>The current implementation uses the MD5 scheme to generate a CryptoHash
from a byte array.

<A name="DataHolder"></A>
<H4>DataHolder (Interface)</H4>

DataHolder is the interface implemented by
<A HREF="#DataHolderSteward">DataHolderStewards</A>.

<P>A DataHolder provides the following methods:
<UL>
<LI>public byte certifiedBy(Verifier verifier);
<LI>public void addCertificate(Certificate certificate);
<LI>public Hashtable getCertificates();
<LI>public Object held() throws IOException;
<LI>public void giveDataTo(DataRequestor requestor);
<LI>void acceptData(Object data, DataRequestor yourRequestor);
<LI>void acceptByteData(byte[] data, DataRequestor yourRequestor);
<LI>void handleFailure(Exception failure, DataRequestor yourRequestor);
</UL>

<A name="DataHolderRecipe"></A>
<H4>DataHolderRecipe (Class)</H4>

Extends Recipe.

A DataHolderRecipe is used for making Recipes for
<A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolders</A>.

<A name="DataHolderSteward"></A>
<H4>DataHolderSteward (Class)</H4>

Implements <A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolder</A>,
<A HREF="#DataRequestor">DataRequestor</A>, Serializable,
RtStateUpgradeable

<P>DataHolderSteward is the foremost class to implement the
<A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolder</A>
interface - An object that knows how to attempt to retrieve some
data that it is a placeholder for.  A DataHolderSteward has the following
state variables:

<UL>
<LI>myFulfiller is the capability needed to retrieve the data and is
not exposed to the users - all they can do is ask for the one piece
of data the <A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolder</A> stands for.

<LI><A HREF="#CryptoHash">cryptoHash</A> is the cryptographic hash of the
data.

<LI>myDataRequestor is either an object that implements the Requestor
interface or a Vector of objects that do. We check which one it is
before calling any methods on it. We do this after we retrieve the
data we stand for, either synchronously (if the data was in the
Repository) or asynchronously (if we had to retrieve it over the
network).
</UL>

<P>These objects are intermediates (or rather, switchboards or
redirectors, given multiple repositories, network sites to retrieve
data from, and multiple vats) between the Repository and
RepositoryPublishers/WWWeb on one side and the users of data on the
other. As such intermediaries they implement both the
<A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolder</A>
and <A HREF="#DataRequestor">DataRequestor</A> interfaces.

<P>The design bears some traces (including the name!) of an earlier
effort to cache data in the <A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolders</A> themselves.
This is not
currently the plan, but it may well be determined that this in fact
is a good place to cache data so the code has not been cleaned up
to remove the cache stuff, mainly the Tether holding on to the data
after retrieval.

<A name="DataRequestor"></A>
<H4>DataRequestor (Interface)</H4>

Anyone using DataHolders needs to define a callback object that
implements the DataRequestor interface. It will get called with the
data when the data becomes available.
<UL>
<LI>void acceptData(Object data, DataRequestor yourRequestor);
<LI>void acceptByteData(byte[] data, DataRequestor yourRequestor);
<LI>void handleFailure(Exception failure, DataRequestor yourRequestor);
</UL>

<A name="Fulfiller"></A>
<H4>Fulfiller (Class)</H4>

Implements <A HREF="#DataRequestor">DataRequestor</A>

<P>A Fulfiller is a Guest object that knows how to resolve
<A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolders</A>
to their specified objects. Fulfillers are created for you at
startup and when you connect to a new host. The appropriate
Fulfiller is added through parimeterization to every
<A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolder</A> you
get from local repositories or from the remote host by your own
Comm system, upon decode of the <A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolder</A>.

<P>The URL to use to lookup or search for the data is constructed of
pieces that get appended together: The hints (several may be
available), and The <A HREF="#CryptoHash">CryptoHash</A> key (as a hex
integer), and possibly other stuff. The design of this is open-ended - Hints
are specified to be an array of strings but we don't specify (yet) a format
for them or how we will interpret them.

<P>For the Beta release, we will support only the most fundamental
hint: The hint is a SturdyRef to a
<A HREF="OldRepository.html#RepositoryPublisher">RepositoryPublisher</A>
 in some COSM
client or server that publishes the object. Frequently this will be
the srver or client that hosts the unum using the object in
question.

<P>Design Reminder: We must spend some effort in examining all constructed
URL's to make sure that they look "normal" , so that noone can sneak in a
URL that terminates before the <A HREF="#CryptoHash">CryptoHash</A> key is
appended. This parser may need to detect other URL terminator strings
besides "?".

<A name="RemoteRetriever"></A>
<H4>RemoteRetriever (Interface)</H4>

To request data from a remote location you use some capability implementing 
RemoteRetriever.
<UL>
<LI>public void requestByteRetrieval(CryptoHash hash, Vector myHints, DataRequestor requestor)
         throws IOException;
</UL>

<A name="RemoteDownloader"></A>
<H4>RemoteDownloader (Class)</H4>

Implements <A HREF="#RemoteRetriever">RemoteRetriever</A>.

<A name="RemoteDownloaderMaker"></A>
<H4>RemoteDownloaderMaker (Class)</H4>

The RemoteDownloaderMaker is a MagicPowerMaker for creating
<A HREF="#RemoteDownloader">RemoteDownloaders</A>.

<P>The RemoteDownloader attempts to fulfill
<A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolders</A> by downloading the data over the net
whenever the data in the <A HREF="#DataHolder">DataHolders</A> cannot be
found in the local Repository.
if successful in getting the data, the data is saved in the
<A HREF="#CacheRepository">CacheRepository</A>
so it won't have to be donwloaded again.

<P>The RemoteDownloader is STEWARD. The <A HREF="#Fulfiller">Fulfiller</A>
accesses it through its
<A HREF="#ParimeterizedRepository">ParimeterizedRepository</A> reference.

<A name="PublishFulfillerMaker"></A>
<H4>PublishFulfillerMaker (Class)</H4>

<P>Given an Environment capability, return one canonicaal
PublishFulfiller object.  A PublishFulfiller is simply a fulfiller
with a hints vector containing our
<A HREF="OldRepository.html#RepositoryPublisher">RepositoryPublisher</A>,
implying that the objects are published by us.

<P>This maker can be called from both CREW and GUEST environments.

<P>While fulfillers can be created without added capabilities besides
a <A HREF="OldRepository.html#ParimeterizedRepository">ParimeterizedRepository</A>
it is convenient and efficient to share
one single fulfiller as much as possible since this may cut down on
network traffic.

<A name="ReposableMarker"></A>
<H4>ReposableMarker (Interface)</H4>

Extends SerializableMarker.

<P>A marker interface for what can go into a Repository.

<P>DataHolders must be encoded
as-they-are into the checkpoint file since they reference their
<A HREF="#Fulfiller">Fulfillers</A> and other in-vat objects in a manner
that is not
possible to reconstruct before a vat exists; therefore, at
revival time we cannot use the same recipes we'd use when
reconstituting from a Repository. Nor would we want to, since
that'd be more work.

<A name="ChipNotes"></A>
<H2>An appendix from Chip about DataHolders</H2>

<I>From a set of design notes entitled
<A HREF="../../design_notes/repository.txt">
"The Repository, Unum Templates, Certification, and Production"</A>
by Chip, Trev, and Robj (with MarcS) <B>[97/05/17]</B>:</I>

<P>Quoth Chip:

<P>A couple of clarifications on data holders. I don't believe this is material to
the story you are telling here, but some details will matter for implementors:

<UL>
<LI>A KnownDataHolder contains a repository key. Retrieval is nominally synchronous
and assumed to be successful except under extraordinary circumstances.
<LI>An ExpectedDataHolder contains a repository key together with URL hints about
where the object might plausibly be obtained. Retrieval is nominally
asynchronous and while expected to be successful not presumed to be.
<LI>The Haberdashery (now to be merged with the Repository) supports an additional
layer of referencing mechanism which uses the Unit abstraction to support a
conventional hierarchical namespace on top of raw repository key mechanism. I
have some additional work (just work, not purple) to do to reconcile the older
Haberdashery lookup methods that use Unit pathnames with the newer
Known/ExpectedDataHolder abstraction.

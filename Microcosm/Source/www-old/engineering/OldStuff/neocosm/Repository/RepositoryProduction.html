<H2>Introduction</H2>

[<I>98/07/02 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>]
A RepositoryProducer is to be used for building repositories offline,
and will deal in String names for the data and correlate said names to
CryptoHashes internally so that the user never has to know about such things.
This is the tool of choice for a production group dealing with
putting together a Repository for a new catalog of art and animation--Basically
a tool for build Repositories from scratch offline rather than tweaking a
Repository while running an application such as HabiSplat.

<H2>Requirements</H2>

[<I>98/07/02 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>] Notes from a
talk with Tony:
<ul>
<li>Sits on top of a <A HREF="RepositoryManagement.html">RepositoryManager</A>.
<li>Sets protocol "Look file names up from disk" OR "Look file names
up in current Repository".
<li>Keeps Vector of referenced CryptoHashes in "extra info" field for re-cooking
when a filename->CryptoHash partnership changes.
<li>Needs Hashtable of old CryptoHash->filename relationships for replacing
CryptoHashes when the underlying file changes (i.e. changing "foo.bmp" from
showing a red square to showing a green square would change the CryptoHash,
so Appearance2Ds which used to refer to the red CryptoHash now need to be
rewritten to refer to the green CryptoHash).
<li>Currently contains Appearance2Ds, Appearance3Ds, bitmaps, VRML, sound(?).
<li>Should expand to contain code/classes, realm/catalog texts...
</ul>


<H2>Architecture</H2>

<H4><a name="PAO">Proposed Architecture Overview</A></H4>
[<I>98/07/02 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>]

This architecture fulfills the <A HREF="#Requirements">requirements</A>
listed above.

<a name="FileFormat">
<P><A HREF="#REQ1">Requirement 1</A>: I think the RepositoryProducer should
extend RepositoryManager.

<ul>
<a name="RepositoryProduction"></a>
<li>interface <b>RepositoryProduction</b> (read "put" as "replace")
	<ul>
	<li>getting and puting and deleting data (bits) by name
	<li>reading and writing data streams by name
	<li>getting and puting and deleting hints by name
	<li>getting and puting and deleting certificates by name
	<li>getting and puting text files (which are then "compiled" into data) by name?
	<li>writing out a <A HREF="RepositoryFile.html#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFile</A>
	<li>compacting a <A HREF="RepositoryFile.html#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFile</A>
	</ul>
<a name="RepositoryProducer"></a>
<li>class <b>RepositoryProducer</b>
	<ul>
	<li>implements <A HREF="#RepositoryProduction ">RepositoryProduction </A>
	<li>implements <A HREF="RepositoryManagement.html#RepositoryManagement ">RepositoryManagement </A>
	<li>contains a RandomAccessFile of data
	<li>contains old and new Hashtables for data, hints and certificates
	<li>correlates names to CryptoHashes internally
	<li>updates (writes out only the new tables) a <b>RepositoryFile</b> faster than
	writing a whole new one
	</ul>
</ul>

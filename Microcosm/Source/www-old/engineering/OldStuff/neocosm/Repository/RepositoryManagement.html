<H2>Introduction</H2>

[<I>98/07/02 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>]
The RepositoryManager picks up all of the meta-tasks such as organizing
multiple Repositories (files, caches, network sources) and dealing with
cacheing recently looked up data with options to reread the original source
instead of using a cached version.  It will also handle streaming from one
Repository to another for large sets of data, and it will allow manipulation
of the protocol governing how things are looked up--Either from local caches
or files first, or from the network first, or whatever other schemes we may
come up with.

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<H4><a name="PAO">Proposed Architecture Overview</A></H4>

[<I>98/07/09 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>] I am proposing
two Java elements for Repository management; the <b>RepositoryManagement</b>
interface and the <b>RepositoryManager</b> class:

<ul>
<a name="RepositoryManagement"></a>
<li>interface <b>RepositoryManagement</b>
	<ul>
	<li>extends <A HREF="RepositoryFile.html#WriteableRepositoryFiling">WriteableRepositoryFiling</A>
	<li>open/close RepositoryFile
	<li>set lookup protocol
	</ul>
<a name="RepositoryManager"></a>
<li>class <b>RepositoryManager</b>
	<ul>
	<li>implements <b>RepositoryManagement</b>
	<li>contains Vector of <A HREF="RepositoryFile.html#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>
	<li>contains Vector of remote <A HREF="Repository.html#Repository">Repositories</A>
	<li>contains Hashtable of recently looked up data
	<li>provides mechanism for streaming from one <b>Repository</b> into another
	<li>provides mechanism for downloading via hints
	<li>provides mechanism for defining lookup protocols (local first, hints first, etc.)
	</ul>
</ul>

In addition to the methods from the 
<A HREF="RepositoryFile.html#WriteableRepositoryFiling">WriteableRepositoryFiling</A>
interface, the <B>RepositoryManagement</B> interface will require
further methods.  The main one will be for opening and closing
RepositoryFiles (either read-only or read/writeable).  Another will be
for setting the lookup protocol.

<P>The <b>RepositoryManager</b> class will implement <b>RepositoryManagement</b>
and contain Vectors of <A HREF="RepositoryFile.html#RepositoryFile">RepositoryFiles</A>
which have been opened and of remote Repositories which have been accessed
via the following of hints.  Any data that is requested from the
<b>RepositoryManager</b> via the "getting and caching data by CryptoHash"
method from the
<A HREF="RepositoryFile.html#RepositoryFiling">RepositoryFiling</A>
interface will be stored into a local Hashtable for quicker access in case it
is requested again.


<P>There will be internal methods which will deal with opening streams
for copying data from one Repository to another when large pieces/quantities
of data need to be moved around.  There will alse be methods for decoding/interpreting
the hints and going out onto the net to find the appropriate data.

<P>The lookup protocol method(s) will accept
lists of Repositories (by name, probably) and/or types (i.e. "Local", "Network")
defining the desired search order.

</P>

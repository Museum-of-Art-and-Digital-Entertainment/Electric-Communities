Deconstructing E</H1>
&nbsp;This page was originally written by <A HREF="mailto:arturo@communities.com">Arturo</A>,
it is a very initial draft.

<P>Last updated: [98/05/18 Arturo - First checked in]
<H2>
1. Introduction</H2>
We've spent a fair amount of time discussing E and its benefits:
<UL>
<LI>
Asynchronous messaging and deadlock avoidance.</LI>

<LI>
Optimistic object references.</LI>

<LI>
Capability security.</LI>

<LI>
Network object messaging.</LI>
</UL>
This document is an attempt at separating all of the different components
of E and examining their cost/benefit tradeoffs.

2. Deconstructing E</H2>

<H3>
2.1. Within process asynchronous messaging</H3>
This is basically an event queue with capability security in the send/delivery
mechanisms..
<UL>
<H4>
2.1.1. Assumptions</H4>
Threads are difficult to program in, there are synchronization issues that
depending on a number of circumstances can lead to deadlock.
<H4>
2.1.2. Benefits</H4>

<UL>
<LI>
The single Run Queue has many synchronization and consistency benefits.
Basically objects that are strictly invoked from the RunQ (or indirectly
so) don't need to worry about synchronizing over methods or data.</LI>

<LI>
Asynchronous programming is less prone to deadlocks. (i.e. you need to
deadlock by design, rather than by consequence of a number of factors).</LI>

<LI>
When used for network messages it compensates for latency, avoiding the
need to wait for a result or acknowledgment from the other side.</LI>

<LI>
Ideal for multicasting where the notions of result don't scale.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
2.1.3. Costs</H4>

<UL>
<LI>
It is a significant change from the well understood synchronous invocation
programming and design requires very thorough understanding of cause and
effect of events (what we like to call causality programming).</LI>

<LI>
Operations that need to return information require a separate return message
(unless you have object futures, which have their own tradeoffs).</LI>

<LI>
You need to be careful about keeping said part of the application away
from side-affecting threads.</LI>

<LI>
Error handling and value returning becomes much more difficult since the
error happens at a later point in time when the state of the invocating
object could have changed.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
2.1.4. Notes on asynchronous error handling</H4>
There are three kinds of errors that can occur on an async invocation:
<UL>
<LI>
Unexpected invocation error usually reflected by RuntimeExceptions.</LI>

<LI>
Expected invocation error, noted by a 'throws' statement on the method.</LI>

<LI>
Errors that happen as a result of this object asynchronously invoking on
other objects.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
2.1.5. Required components</H4>

<UL>
<LI>
Run Queue</LI>

<LI>
CRAPI based invocation mechanism</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
2.2. Generic invocation interface (call, send)</H3>

<UL>The first versions of E (please correct me here if I'm wrong) generated
classes for all the different kinds of stubs, since at that time we did
not have CRAPI there was no way to do a generic invocation interface. Now
we have an interface is used to describe every single kind of invocation:

<P><TT>void sendOnly(target, "methodName", args[]);</TT>

<P>This allows us to write intermediaries that extend object invocation
behavior.
<H4>
2.2.1.&nbsp; Benefits</H4>
Intermediary objects that extend behavior with minimal class bloat. Examples
are:
<UL>
<LI>
Channels.</LI>

<LI>
Proxies.</LI>

<LI>
Revocable forwarders.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
2.2.2. Costs</H4>
In applying this you loose all the typing information, this makes programming,
debugging and maintenance more difficult. The only way to get the type
information back is by having some form of stubs that</UL>

<H3>
2.3. Stubs or lack of thereof</H3>
One of the issues with a generic invocation interface is the difficulty
with typing issues, stubs allow you to have strong typing, but they always
come at a cost. In the first generations of E we had a compiler generate
a number of stub classes where each class would have a different internal
invocation for every method, thanks to CRAPI and Danfuzz this evolved into
Stubs that turn a strongly typed call into a generic asyncrhonous invocation.
See <A HREF="e/ProxyTyping.html">Robj's digression on proxy typing</A>.

<P>Stubs can serve two different purposes:
<UL>
<LI>
Provide objects of the right type that you invoke synchronously that generate
the generic invocation.</LI>

<LI>
Strongly typed variables that are only used as references in invocations
(El Cheapo).</LI>

<H4>
2.3.1. No Stubs</H4>
This is when you decide to use the generic invocation interface for every
async message send.
<UL>
<LI>
Benefit: No bloat of any kind whatsoever.</LI>

<LI>
Cost: Lose all of the typing information, and hence lose the compiler support
and code clarity that comes with it.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
2.3.2. Compiler generated stubs.</H4>

<UL>
<LI>
Benefit: Strongly typed stubs that can be used to invoke through and even
have exception handling information.</LI>

<LI>
Cost: Class bloat.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>
2.3.3. Runtime generated stubs.</H4>

<H4>
2.3.4. El Cheapo</H4>
</UL>

<H3>
2.4. Object futures</H3>
Otherwise known as optimistic object references, channels, promises, unresolved
object references, etc. Well, not quite since all of these are not the
same, although they are based on the same principal.
<UL>
<H4>
2.4.1. As object message queues.</H4>

<H4>
2.4.2. As object value futures.</H4>

<H4>
2.4.3. The network, security and optimistic object references.</H4>
</UL>

<H3>
2.5. Promises as return values of 'send'</H3>

<LI>
Object pass by copy transport/serialization.</LI>

<LI>
Support for (fragile) objects that get exported by proxy.</LI>

management.</LI>

<LI>
How much of the existing code to leverage?</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
Exception handling, alternatives and multicast group management are issues
that need to be evaluated and understood at every level of the system.

<P>This is a description of a possible layering of the comm system:
<H3>
3.2. Data Comm System (Socket+)</H3>
This layer is responsible for connection set up, tear down, bit transport,
authentication, encryption, compression.
<UL>
<H4>
3.2.1. Connection management</H4>

<H4>
3.2.6. Multicast support</H4>
</UL>

<H3>
3.3. Object&nbsp; transport System (Java Serialization + Data Comm integration)</H3>
This layer is responsable for the per message encoding and decoding of
an object graph.
<UL>

With this we provide an abstraction for object to object inter-process
messaging.
<UL>
<H4>
3.4.1. Objects passed by proxy i.e. Exportable</H4>
There is a certain number of classes/interfaces defined to be Exportable.
(Actually based on El Cheapo they would extend BaseExportable)
<H4>
3.4.2. Object Swiss Numbers</H4>

<H4>
3.4.3. Import/Export tables</H4>
They need weak pointers to enable acyclic network garbage collection.
<H4>
3.4.4. Process Identity</H4>

<H4>
3.4.5. Registrar</H4>
Center for managing multiple connections.
<BR>Which holds the private public key pair used to
<H4>
3.4.6. SturdyRefs</H4>
A SturdyRef is the combination of:
<BR>[Information to contact the machine + Object's Swiss number]
<BR>There are issues relating to the lifetime of SturdyRefs and dealing
with live references upon revocation.
<H4>
3.4.7. Object to object reliability and ordering</H4>

<H4>
3.4.8. Async object garbage collection for proxies (wire protocol)</H4>
Needs a clean up protocol to deal with race conditions by using a wire
counting protocol. The race condition is that the proxy might get garbage
collected</UL>

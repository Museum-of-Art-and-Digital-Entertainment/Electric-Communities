Introduction</H2>
WHAT!?!?&nbsp; You are probably thinking this right now:&nbsp; "why they
hell do we need more infrastructure?".&nbsp; "Don't we have enough infrastructure
already?".&nbsp; "Why have <I>another </I>complicated system?"

<P>Well, these are good questions.&nbsp; I think it's clear to most everyone
that we have too much infrastructure right now.&nbsp; My answer to these
questions is simple, however:&nbsp; Given our current infrastructure and
problems with same, I think we can benefit from doing this piece of the
system as simply and generally as possible.

<P>My intention was to produce a distributed object infrastructure that
satisfied the following constraints:&nbsp; 1) All java.&nbsp; 2) Simple
(my grandmother can understand it...but my grandmother is very smart ;-);
3) Very general (able to support all of our current distributed object
requirements); 4) Very exstensible; 5) Small (code size goal: &lt; 200k);
6) Performs well; 7) Performs reliably for known reasons.

<A NAME="Architecture"></A>Architecture</H2>
In essence, DObjects is a minimal framework for implementing the basic
Unum/Presence distributed system structure that we already know and love.&nbsp;
In this respect it is like Pluribus...i.e. it's centered around a model
of distributing objects in a multipoint system, and allowing the presences
of any given distributed object to have <B>arbitrary </B>representations
on all of the machines where it executes its client code (determined by
the host).&nbsp; In this way, it doesn't really say <I>anything </I>about
the actual contents of the distributed objects, but rather only deals with
the meta operations of the distributed system:&nbsp; reliable group membership
(so multipoint message failure has some meaning), and the basics of distributed
object 'lifecycle' management:&nbsp; distributed creation, distributed
destruction (and garbage collection), meta-protocols to allow secure interaction
with other distributed objects, secure resource control (e.g. access to
Vat resources).

<P>It differs from pluribus in a couple of key respects:&nbsp; 1) It is
not based around a language.&nbsp; Everything is in java.&nbsp; 2) The
multipoint 'Session' is a fundamental concept, primarily present to provide
reliability and group membership information in multipoint messaging based
on the notion of 'object group' computing (see <A HREF="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/groups/groups.html">Doug
Lea's notes on Object Groups</A>). 3) The functionality of this framework
is focussed strictly on the 'meta' operations needed to provide a <B>multipoint
</B>distributed object layer (creation, destruction, inter-distributed-object-introduction,
secure access to system resources).&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and by the way, just
in case there is any doubt or concern:&nbsp; it's not IDMOO...it's a totally
different/simpler/cleaner implementation, with much less code, and (I think)
more functionality (particularly WRT facet-based security).

<P>For the theoretically minded (if not, just skip over this paragraph),
it is inspired by the notion of a 'meta-protocol' for distributed multipoint
objects...which I realized was what we are trying to do (create a multipoint
distributed object meta-protocol), after reading a good portion of the
book '<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/Author=Kiczales%2C%20Gregor/002-3294774-4390402">The
Art of the Meta-Object Protocol' by Gregor Kiczales</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
problem we are facing at the distributed object layer of our system, IMHO,
is one of building a meta-object protocol for a multipoint distributed
system, and reliably providing the meta operations for such a system (creation,
destruction, error handling, meta-protocols between objects, etc) with
the minimal infrastructure possible.&nbsp; Note such a meta protocol does
not say anything about the actual semantics of the relationships between
the distributed objects, nor about the state management (distributed, centralized,
in between) of the distributed object, it just supports these meta operations
on the distributed objects.

<P>The DObjects stuff is based around the notion of a multipoint 'Session'.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the purposes of this document, a 'Session' is defined as:&nbsp; A group
of processes (>= 1) interacting with one another for a finite length of
time (actually, the notion of a 'SessionMember' described below is not
limited to 1 per process...rather it supports the notion of having multipoint
local 'SessionMember' in a single process all of which represent membership
in a local or remote group...for example, a hub could easily have several
multipoint SessionMember instances, with multiple regions all within a
single java process).&nbsp; This notion of session is very general, and
doesn't say anything about objects, regions, or anything having to do with
a virtual space per se.&nbsp; Application specific examples of application
uses of the session concept are:&nbsp; 1) a bridged audio conference, 2)
a 'region' of a multiuser virtual space; 3) a multiuser bridge game; 4)
a transaction in a distributed database.&nbsp; This is not an uncommon
concept for distributed systems.&nbsp; If you look at much of the non-trivial
multipoint distributed objects work out there, much of it is focussed around
the concept of a multipoint group or session (examples:&nbsp; the <A HREF="http://www.infospheres.caltech.edu">infospheres
work at caltech</A>, the <A HREF="http://simon.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/HORUS/">Horus
project at Cornell</A>, the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com:80/products/jms/index.html">java
messaging service</A>, etc.).&nbsp; These references provide several good
reasons for the focus on a 'session' concept, primarily these reasons revolve
around the function of a session as an explicit group membership manager
to provide support for reliable multipoint messaging.

<P>One way to reify the notion of a multipoint group or 'Session' is to
have every process' <B>interface </B>to a session be through an explicit
class called a 'SessionMember'.&nbsp; This class is meant to represent
each machine's access to the 'thing that is made up by all of the machines
interacting with one another' (aka the Session).&nbsp; It is the local
machine's access to the multi-machine Session.&nbsp; In the DObjects code,
this is represented by the abstract class <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">ec.dom.session.SessionMember</A>,
and its subclasses:&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/ClientSessionMember.html">ec.dom.session.ClientSessionMember</A>
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/ServerSessionMember.html">ec.dom.session.ServerSessionMember.</A>&nbsp;
Note that the abstract SessionMember class does not have any knowledge
about the network topology that it is running on...that's provided by the
subclasses.&nbsp; This is intentional, as it gives a mechanism to implement
a topology-independent multipoint messaging interface, and allows us to
replace one topology for another (i.e. multicast for star topology) without
affecting the layers 'above' that depend upon this ('the distributed objects').&nbsp;
This is very desireable, as it isolates the topology dependence to one
layer in the system.&nbsp; See the <A HREF="MultipointCommSystem.html">Ideas
for a Multipoint Comm System</A>.

<P>The key added value for the notion of a 'Session' (and its local reification,
the '<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember</A>'
class), is to provide a reliable multipoint messaging abstraction.&nbsp;
By way of comparison, consider the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com:80/products/jdk/1.1/docs/api/java.net.MulticastSocket.html#_top_">MulticastSocket
</A>class in the java api.&nbsp; This class is analogous to the SessionMember
in DObjects except for one thing:&nbsp; the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com:80/products/jdk/1.1/docs/api/java.net.MulticastSocket.html#_top_">MulticastSocket
</A>abstraction has no notion of reliable message delivery, and the DObjects
<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html">SessionMember
</A>class does.&nbsp; This makes it possible for another piece of code
that relies upon reliable multipoint messaging to depend upon this property
from the messaging system.&nbsp; This property (reliable multipoint messaging)
is <B>critical </B>for dealing with some n-way distributed system issues...for
example, the Fischer, Lynch, and Patterson impossibility result regarding
the distributed consensus problem (contact me if you want a hardcopy of
this, or references to work describing its relevance/importance).

<P>The property of multipoint messaging reliability relies, in turn, upon
something known as 'group membership'.&nbsp; If you think about it, it
makes a lot of sense:&nbsp; to be able to tell if a message intended for
multiple processes reliably makes it to those processes, it's necessary
to <B>know and agree about what other processes are currently in the group</B>.&nbsp;
As simple as this sounds, determining group membership is not trivial under
many circumstances (in fact, it's a research problem).&nbsp; For example,
building upon an <I>unreliable multicast protocol</I>, defining a reliable
group membership protocol is an extremely hard design problem (if you don't
believe me, see some of the stuff <A HREF="http://simon.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/HORUS/Abstracts.html#tr93-1328">here</A>).&nbsp;
Fortunately for us, however, group membership is trivial with some network
topologies (e.g. the star topology), and so it is not difficult at all
for us to implement given our current system assumptions.&nbsp; So, one
central and critical function of the SessionMember class is to implement
a reliable group membership protocol, so all SessionMembers can get accurate
information about what other processes are currently in the group, and
they can also provide messaging reliability guarantees on top of that group
membership information.&nbsp; This is basically all the SessionMember class
provides, but it is a critical piece of functionality for providing a reliable
multipoint messaging abstraction.

<P>The SessionMember class provides two basic multipoint messaging primitives:&nbsp;
These are the '<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#sendDataToPresences(ec.dom.net.DObjectPacket)">sendDataToPresences</A>'
method, and the '<A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/SessionMember.html#sendDataToPresenceAtSession(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.net.DObjectPacket)">sendDataToPresenceAtSession</A>'
method.&nbsp; These are the main messaging primitives used by the distributed
objects that participate in a multipoint session, and provide the basic
reliable, FIFO (sender) ordered properties that are not guaranteed by (e.g.)
a <A HREF="http://java.sun.com:80/products/jdk/1.1/docs/api/java.net.MulticastSocket.html#_top_">multicast
socket</A> class.

<P>The other key class for the DObjects system is the 'DObject' class.&nbsp;
It's defined in <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html">ec.dom.session.DObject</A>.&nbsp;
This is intended to be the base class for all distributed objects (aka
Una).&nbsp; Actually the DObject class is intended to be conceptually similar
to a Presence in the unum/presence model.&nbsp; This base class is intended
to be used (and is *enforced*) as the base class for all distributed object
presences by the SessionMember code itself, and provides some of the basic
functionality for every presence of a distributed object.&nbsp; Note that
a number of the methods on the DObject class are declared <B>final</B>.&nbsp;
The reason for this is that these methods provide basic functionality for
the distributed object that the local system must guarantee (for example,
proper shutdown and eviction/garbage collection semantics).&nbsp; The guarantee
(by the local classloader) that this class is the top-level superclass
for all untrusted code, that this DObject class is loaded from local disk,
and that these final methods are not overrideable by untrusted code gives
some assurance that the local system can 'have its way' with the local
presence of an untrusted distributed object, and that the meta-operations
of creation and destruction of the untrusted distributed object will be
done 'properly' from the local system's point of view (no resource hogging
from untrusted code).&nbsp; This is a critical guarantee in the case where
the distributed object is using untrusted code (I know we are not doing
this now, but it provides a general and secure mechanism for dealing with
this case).

<P>For example, <A HREF="../containership/dobjects/sld009.htm">here </A>is
the beginning in a sequence of slides (slides 10-16) that graphically and
in prose describes the group membership protocol and DObject presence creation
process within the DObjects framework.&nbsp; The main point to make about
this process is that it solves <B>one </B>subtly hard problem within the
context of a multiuser virtual space jointly hosted on all participating
machines:&nbsp; it allows each DObject to solve the distributed consensus
problem for the existence of itself within the context defined by the multipoint
session.&nbsp; That is, existence of a DObject (creating/removing client
presences of itself in all participating processes) in a multipoint group
<I>is a distributed consensus problem</I>, and the reliability and group
membership properties of the multipoint session (and more specifically
the local SessionMember object) allow the DObjects to reliably solve this
problem for themselves as necessary.&nbsp; This is the main guarantee that
the support for the reliable multicast model delivers:&nbsp; it allows
the distributed consensus problem to be solved.
<H3>
Supporting Host->Client, Client->Host security</H3>
It's important that the DObjects code not only be sufficiently general,
but also that it support our specific patterns of messaging.&nbsp; Specifically,
as part of the security characteristics of the Unum/Presence model, it
is specified that messaging among presences of a given distributed object
occur from Host->Client (for fanout of state changes), and Client->Host
(for state change requests).&nbsp; These are the patterns of use appropriate
for our application (neocosm), and they disallow clients from sending/receiving
messages among themselves (rather than through the host), so that security
assertions can be made in the face of untrusted clients/i.e. hacked machines.

<P>Note that this constraint on the messaging pattern is not a functional
choice, rather it is a security policy choice...i.e. there is no reason
to disallow client->client messaging for some applications.&nbsp; In fact
it is very useful under some application circumstances (for example, the
lilbuddies code uses this pattern to gain significant messaging efficiency
at the cost of ordered delivery).&nbsp; See <A HREF="../../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/tests/lilbuddies/MultipointTextChat.html">here</A>
for example code...see the sendUtteranceToRemotesMethod.&nbsp; In any event,
it's understood that for our app we need to support the secure Host->Clients,
Client->Host messaging patterns, and the DObjects code allows this security
policy to be introduced with almost no code, as described below.

<P>So how to constrain messaging to Host->Clients and Client->Host?&nbsp;
Well, first two assertions can be made:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Every DObject presences
has 'knowledge' of the SessionMemberID where its host is.&nbsp; That is,
for both the Host and all the client presences, there is a member variable
in the DObject class called 'myHomeSessionID' that immutably holds the
session member id where the host instance is located.&nbsp; For client
presences this is set upon construction, and cannot be changed (by subclasses
or anything else).&nbsp; This allows every presence to 'know' where its
host is located.&nbsp; 2) When a DObject presence receives a message from
a remote (host OR client) the session protocol provides the presence with
information <B>about where (SessionMemberID) the message came from</B>.&nbsp;
This information is ultimately tied to the IP address of the sender, and
so cannot be forged.

<P>Specifically, when a message is received by the SessionMember, intended
for a given DObject, the SessionMember code sends an asynchronous message
that ultimately results in the <A HREF="../../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#receiveDataFromRemote(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.util.Data)">DObject.receiveDataFromRemote</A>
method being called.&nbsp; The first parameter to this method is the SessionMemberID
of the SessionMember responsible for sending that message.&nbsp; This (final)
method turns around and calls <A HREF="../../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/DObject.html#receiveClosureFromRemote(ec.dom.session.SessionID, ec.dom.session.Closure)">DObject.receiveClosureFromRemote</A>
(if the data is a message), again passing in the sender SessionMessageID.&nbsp;
The current implementation of receiveClosureFromRemote in the DObject class
does nothing with the provided message except execute it.

<P>Rather than just execute the Closure, we can introduce a 'security policy
check' by simply overriding the receiveClosureFromRemote method.&nbsp;
To implement a policy check to disallow client->client messaging patterns
something like the following method will be written (to be a subclass of
CompositeDObject, I imagine):
<PRE>protected void receiveClosureFromRemote(SessionMemberID fromID, Closure aClosure)</PRE>

<PRE>{</PRE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // First, if client presence check to guarantee that message was sent from sessionmember</PRE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // where host is</PRE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (isClientPresence() &amp;&amp; getHomeID().equals(fromID)) {</PRE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; super.receiveClosureFromRemote(fromID, aClosure);</PRE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</PRE>

<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // otherwise, simply ignore the message (or it could do something more radical, report, etc.)</PRE>

<PRE>}</PRE>
That's it.&nbsp; This would filter all messages such that all client->client
messaging would be disallowed for any subclass of the class defining this
method.&nbsp; Even if a client sent a message to another client, when it
reached this piece of code (on the receiver) it would be dropped/ignored/whatever.
<H4>
Preventing DObjects from sending messages to remote presences of other
DObjects</H4>
Another pattern to prevent is the pattern where a different DObject tries
to send a message to some other remote DObject (i.e. to some presence that
does not belong to it).&nbsp; This messaging pattern is not allowed in
the presence model <B>at all (i.e. DObjects are only able to send messages
across process to presences with the same ID).&nbsp; </B>This constraint
is imposed by the session protocol itself.&nbsp; When a DObject presence
sends a message, it does not specify what remote DObject will receive the
message...this information is automatically included with the message by
the local SessionMember instance and is done such the the sending DObject
cannot spoof another DObject.&nbsp; So in essence, the session protocol
disallows this pattern completely.
<H3>
Why is a session not a region?</H3>
The notion of a session is intended to be more generic than that of a region.&nbsp;
That is, a session is a group of interacting processes (and any/all DObjects
that those processes might host), while a region defines a group of interacting
processes (those within that region) <B>and</B> additional virtual world
semantics.&nbsp; The session separates the meta activities of the distributed
system (e.g. group membership, which is not relevant to the interactions
between DObjects in the object graph directly), from the semantics specific
to interaction within a virtual space (graphical rendering, spatial metaphor,
avatars, interaction between Una, etc., etc.).&nbsp; One advantage of this
is that the notion of a multipoint session can be used in other application
contexts.&nbsp; For example, an audio session, a text chat session, etc.&nbsp;
In all these application contexts a session plays a similar role:&nbsp;
provide support for the basic reliable multipoint messaging requirements
of the application.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally the session does not restrict
the notion of what region is or can be at all...it just off-loads some
of the infrastructure work that our current region implementation is doing
and simplifies it.
<H3>
Multilevel Containment</H3>
What about multilevel containment?&nbsp; We need to be able to have Una
which represent containers of other una...for example, avatars have pockets
that contain other things (props, etc.).&nbsp; You can think of these containers
as being of two basic kinds:&nbsp; open containers and closed containers.
<H4>
Open Containers</H4>
Open containers are those such that when the container (e.g. avatar) 'moves'
from region to region, its contents 'move with it'.&nbsp; Now 'moving with
the container' means that the <B>client presences</B> of both the <I>container
object</I> <B>and</B> the <I>contained object</I> have their presences
destroyed (in the old space) and created (in the new space).&nbsp; So if
the open container moves (or is moved) from one space to another, it has
to have everything it transitively contains also move with it...<B>somehow</B>.&nbsp;
The trick is defining a protocol such that this transitive container tree
transfer happens or fails given a) the need to do TOS checking for the
transfer; b) the need to end up in some consistent state; c) handle arbitrary
partial failure.&nbsp; These are three constraints that are not easy to
jointly satisfy.
<H4>
Closed Containers</H4>
Closed containers do not impose the constraint that when a container is
moved, its contained items go with it.&nbsp; That is, a closed container
(e.g. a box) might maintain <B>internal</B> state about what it contains,
and the items it contains might also maintain state about what they are
contained by, but this container->containable relation is not made known
to the external world or made visible.&nbsp; For example, a closed box
would not make its contained items known to the renderer so that they can
be seen...otherwise, it is essentially an <B>open</B> box.
<H4>
Existing DObjects Designs</H4>
For the DObjects code, I have designed and implemented the basic support
for arbitrary container->containable relations.&nbsp; This code is located
in the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/support/package-summary.html">ec.dom.support</A>
package.&nbsp; In essence, what this is intended to do is to provide the
basic support for arbitrary kinds of container->containable relations:&nbsp;
open containers, closed containers, slotted containers, etc.&nbsp; The
main support for the container functionality is in the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/support/BaseContainer.html">BaseContainer</A>
component (a <B>component</B> is very much analogous to an <B>ingredient</B>
by our current terminology), and the main support for the containable functionality
is in the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/support/BaseContainable.html">BaseContainable</A>
component. There is more to do here to implement the specific semantics
for open containers, closed containers, realm-region containment, etc.,
but these designs and code are meant to provide the basic support for all
of these kinds of containers, and provide the means to deal with a) arbitrary
TOS requirements; b) reaching a consistent state; c) handling arbitrary
failure during the container->containable protocol.
<H4>
Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
None that I know of.&nbsp; There are a number of implementations of reliable
multicast on top of normal multicast IP.&nbsp; These could be of use to
us in the future.
<H4>
Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
Containership.&nbsp; The notion of general open (or closed, slotted, etc.)
containership is supported, and made more easy to implement by introducing
reliable multipoint messaging.&nbsp; In the DObjects implementation, I
have recently added some basic support for generic container-containable
relations.&nbsp; These are in the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/support/package-summary.html">ec.dom.support</A>
package...specifically the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/support/BaseContainer.html">BaseContainer</A>
and <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/support/BaseContainable.html">BaseContainable</A>
classes.
<H2>
Current implementation</H2>

<H4>
Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
The source for all of this code now checked into cvs at ec5/src/javasrc/ec/dom.
<H4>
Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>
Yes.&nbsp; <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/overview-summary.html">Here is
the link to the package index</A>.&nbsp; See the dom packages. There are
also copious comments directly in the source code.
<H4>
Examples</H4>
There are examples included in the Cafe project.&nbsp; Two simple example
test programs are ec.dom.session.tests.TestServerSession.java and ec.dom.session.tests.ThinClient.java
(a client session hardwired to connect to localhost).&nbsp; These are for
testing the group membership protocols and the basic DObject client presence
creation/destruction infrastructure.

<P>Also, the dom.zip file has a simple test app built upon a JavaBean.&nbsp;
The JavaBean is IBM's 'chart' JavaBean, which was written to display a
GUI interface for a graphical chart (histogram, pie chart, etc...configurable
by the programmer).&nbsp; Using the DObjects infrastructure, I created
a distributed voting application, that allows all participants to vote
on any issue, and then use the DObjects messaging infrastructure to update
and synchronize the distributed state of the vote outcome information shown
graphically to all participants using the JavaBean chart object.&nbsp;
Part of doing this was as an exercise to see how easy it would be to make
any JavaBean into a 'distributed JavaBean' using this infrastructure.&nbsp;
As it turns out, it was pretty easy.&nbsp; There are two batch files:&nbsp;
one to start a server (runserver.bat), and the other to start the SunSoft
'beanbox' app as a client.&nbsp; To use this, after starting the client
with runclient.bat, first choose 'File->Connect' to connect to the server
(assumed to be already running on the localhost), then click on the 'DistributedChart'
item in the Toolbox list.&nbsp; This will create an instance of the distributed
chart, and automatically have a client presence created on the server (the
DistributedChart instance is hosted on the client process).
<H4>
Testing and Debugging</H4>
There is plenty of testing desired/required.&nbsp; The main areas for testing
are 1) The basic group membership protocol for the SessionMember class.&nbsp;
2) The default DObject client presence creation and destruction.&nbsp;
3) The DObject&lt;->DObject secure capability exchange meta-protocol.&nbsp;
4) All of the asynchronous messaging constructs for between-presence asynchronous
messaging (e.g. the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/Closure.html">Closure
</A>class, the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/session/BaseFacet.html">BaseFacet
</A>classes).&nbsp; 5) All of the available code to support multi-level
containment (i.e. everything in the <A HREF="../../ec5/doc/javadoc/ec/dom/support/package-summary.html">ec.dom.support
package</A>).

<P>Integration with the new comm system.&nbsp; See notes on this in the
<A HREF="MultipointCommSystem.html">Ideas for Multipoint Comm System</A>.

<P>Use of MicroVats and one thread per MicroVat (the DObjects approach
currently uses one-thread-per microvat, but can be adopted to use one thread
for all microvats...there is just a small amount of work involved).

<H1>Core E Language Support </H1>

<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>
We created a set of classes to provide primitive data types and
other basic building block components for E. These are distinct
from the runtime classes (such as channels) which are necessary
for E to work at all. Rather, these were to be the basic data
objects for optimistic computation.
<P>
Note that due to the sorry state of this collection, I am deviating
from the established format for the Cosm Subsystem Survey as it
is makes little sense for this case.<BR>

<H2>Requirements </H2>

<P>
The requirement which these classes were to meet was simply to
provide a set of optimistic analogs to the standard set of Java
scalar classes (<B>Integer</B>, <B>Long</B>, <B>String</B>, <B>Double</B>,
etc). The idea was that each such Java class should map to a corresponding
eclass with the same functionality as the Java class' associated
primitive type, but with the operations provided via an optimistic
interface.
<P>
At the same time, we also felt a need for optimistic support for
other Java language features, and these were grouped with the
core eclasses for convenience.<BR>

<H2>What we've got</H2>

<P>
The design of the basic set of core E language eclasses is quite
simple. For each of the Java scalar wrapper classes (<B>Integer</B>
et al), we create a corresponding eclass with the same name but
with the letter &quot;E&quot; prepended to the name. For example,
the Java class <B>Integer</B> corresponds to the eclass <B>EInteger</B>.
The eclass has a constructor which accepts a parameter of the
scalar type it wraps and a <B>value()</B> method which returns
this wrapped scalar value. Thus <B>EInteger</B> holds, and its
value() method returns, an <B>int</B>. Finally, each of the primitive
operations supported by the wrapped scalar class has an associated
emethod which performs the same operation optimistically using
E messaging. For example, the Java integer &quot;+&quot; operation
maps to the <B>EInteger</B> add operation:
<PRE>
<FONT SIZE=2>    /** Add two EIntegers, resulting in a new EInteger */
    emethod add(EInteger operand, EResult result) {
        ewhen operand (int operandValue) {
            result &lt;- forward(new EInteger(myValue + operandValue));
        }
    }
</FONT>
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the operands to the arithmetic operation are both <B>EIntegers</B>
(the first operand is the recipient of the message, the second
is the first argument) and the channel for the result is explicitly
passed as an argument.
<P>
The current collection of support eclasses includes <B>EBoolean</B>,
<B>EDouble</B>, <B>EFloat</B>, <B>EInteger</B>, <B>ELong</B> and
<B>EString</B> (for reasons lost to history we never did an <B>ECharacter</B>
or <B>EShort</B>). Of these, only <B>EBoolean</B>, <B>EInteger</B>
and <B>EString</B> are ever actually used (<B>ELong</B> is imported
in a few places but not used; this should be cleaned up). In addition,
despite of the extensive protocols which these objecs offer, the
only way they are ever used is as optimistic value holders (i.e.,
the only methods that ever get invoked are the constructor and
<B>value()</B>). Given the inherent overhead in the E runtime,
the ability to do, for example, arithmetic in an optimistic manner
has proven to be of academic interest only.
<P>
The set of core E support classes also includes some other miscellany:
<P>
The eclass <B>EPrintStream</B> wraps a Java <B>PrintStream</B>
object and handles the case of being asked to print an <B>EObject</B>
by doing an ewhen to wait for its value. Due to the asynchrony
of ewhen, this is of dubious value and is not used anywhere in
the current code base.
<P>
Similarly, an eclass <B>ETrace</B> provides an asynchronous wrapping
of the <B>RtTrace</B> protocol, and is unused, being basically
useless.
<P>
The class <B>EServices</B> provides a Vat-safe access to the <B>System</B>
class. Currently the only <B>System</B> class operation which
it supports is the static <B>arraycopy()</B> method - the one
service <B>System</B> provides which any object legitimately ought
to be able to use. This was implemented to allow us to remove
the <B>System</B> class from &quot;safe Java&quot;, but in practice
turns out not to be used anywhere.
<P>
The eclass <B>EObjectFuture</B> holds onto an <B>EObject</B>,
while the class <B>jObjectFuture</B> holds onto an ordinary Java
object. Both of these classes provide a <B>value()</B> method
such that they may be used as the target of an ewhen operation.
In contrast to much of the rest of this package, these two classes
actually are used somewhat (in ingredient code).
<P>
All of these classes and eclasses are in the package <B>ec.e.lang</B>,
with the exception of <B>EBoolean</B> which is in <B>ec.e.run</B>
because it is used extensively by the E runtime itself and so
needs to be in the same package with the runtime in order to avoid
circular build dependencies.<BR>

<H2>What to do </H2>

<P>
In spite of the effort invested in these classes, as a practical
matter the only use we get out of any of them is as futures. However,
new E eliminates the need for specialized classes to do this.
I propose that as part of the conversion to New E we get rid of
the whole <B>ec.e.lang</B> package. We would need to replace the
60 or so current uses of <B>EBoolean</B>, <B>EInteger</B>, <B>EString</B>,
<B>EObjectFuture</B> and <B>jObjectFuture</B> with the appropriate
corresponding New E idioms.

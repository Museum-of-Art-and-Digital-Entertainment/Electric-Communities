<title>Hub Requriements</title>

<h1>Hub requirements and strawman task spec</h1>

<p>Here's a loose list of "features" that are specific to the "hub" side of things.

<p>I look at the "hub" features as additional, and in some cases, external, components that 
add value to the basic "cosm" application.  The value-add is in the form of features that 
facilitate the support of large communities.  <b>Keep in mind that these requirement need to
be taken into account when designing and implementing other features.</b> &nbsp For example, the
realm and region need to support hub requirements.

<p>This list is derived from collecting past notes, emails, etc, on current
hub requirements, current knowledge of the alpha, and changes 
to r167 that we want to make. There has been some review of this
by RobJ, Dean, and John.  Send comments to <a href=mailto:jeff@communities.com>jeff</a>.

<p>I've used an outline format which is a bit terse, however I think this is
the best way to present this info.  For each item, I've included...
<ul>
<li>A name for the feature with a "Priority" label which is a number between 1 and 4 on 
how "important" *I* think the requirement/feature is for the product.
<li>A short description of the feature, including requirements.
<li>Whether or not its in r167, and if its not in r167 whether it was spec'ed.
<li>A list of design and implemntation tasks neccessary to complete the feature.
</ul>

<p>I've attempted to order these so that related items are "kept together".
Other than that, ordering is somewhat random.

<h5><a name=gendir>Generic directory support (Priority 1)</a></h5>

<ul>
    <li> The current directory in r167 is
        limited. LDAP directory technology is available off the
        shelf and is quite flexible. Java access to LDAP
        directories is supported through the use of JNDI. The
        idea here is that we investigate and use an off-the-shelf
        directory server for the directory component of the hub
        product.</li>
    <li> r167 has a special purpose limited avatar directory using sqlserver.</li>
    <li> required for full up community.</li>
    <li> Use LDAP directories, JNDI.</li>
    <li> Sort out LDAP server alternatives (probably just use netscape directory server).</li>
    <li> Need to sort out update authentication story.</li>
    <li> Spec dir entry attributes, JNDI/EC integration story.</li>
    <li> Implement initial directory using EC ID, integrated with our code.</li>
    <li> Implement update authentication.</li>
</ul>


<h5><a name=webdir>Web Based Directory Browser (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> It would be ideal if the generic directory was browsable on the web, only because the web browser is a common denominator frontend application platform.  There are off the shelf tools to support this.. exactly how useful these tools are is unknown.
<li> Required for full up community.
<li> Possibly use off-the-shelf software. (wax500?)
</ul>

<h5><a name=persondir>Person Directory (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> This is a directory based on the generic directory support 
that stores information about individual members of a world. 
"Member" could mean avatar, or it could mean the actual person.  
A key issue that we have to solve here is what attributes we 
want to store in the directory for each entry, and how we plan 
to collect the values for the attributes.  Finally, its possible 
that we want to use the address book as a frontend browser to 
the person directory.  Key requirements are:
    <ul>
      <li> List/search members that have registered with the realm(s).
      <li> Address book me page is published by user's and stored in the directory.
      <li> There needs to be a privacy story, eg how do I control access to my info?
      <li> UI Frontend on the web for searching; address book for update.
      <li> Admin tool on the web for editing/browsing directory.
    </ul>
<li> r167 has a special purpose limited avatar directory based on sql server. 
See <a href=http://www-int/engineering/OldStuff/neocosm/hub/avatardir.html>http://www-int/engineering/OldStuff/neocosm/hub/avatardir.html</a> for complete details.
<li> required for full up community.
<li> Uses generic directory support.
<li> Need design story on how folk get added to the directory/
<li> Spec directory attributes.
<li> Need story on how this is related to address book. (This may affect address book design.)
</ul>

<h5><a name=placedir>Place Directory (Priority 3)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> By using a generic directory mechanism such as LDAP, its possible to build
  a "directory of places".  The frontend ui for the place directory could be the
  web (possible in the form of a map of maps), or even the address book, maybe
  in the form of a "places" tab.  This task includes sorting out what the attributes
  are for entries in a place directory.  Attributes might include a short description of 
  of the realm, and the URL to the TOS page for the realm.  Other requirements
  include:
      <li> Be able to list/search for realms and link to the map for a realm.
      <li> Show current user counts for a realm or realms.
      <li> UI frontend on the web only (address book possible).
      <li> Admin frontend on the web allowing for adding/editing of entries.
<li> r167 has map.
<li> Required when there is lots of communities out there.
<li> Uses generic directory support.
<li> Design "launch cosm from place directory".  (Probably just a simple URL.)
<li> Need story on how this is related to address book.
<li> Place Directory Browser (probably web based) spec, design, implement.
</ul>

<h5><a name=ntservice>NT Service Runner (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> The NT Service Runner (ecntsvc.exe) is required if we want hub-o-cosm to run
  at startup.  On NT, processes that run at startup in the background, are called
  services.  The NT web server, IIS, is an example of one of the services.  
  There is a service control panel that is used to start and stop these processes.  
<li> currently in r167.
<li> Fix ODBC bug; required if we want the java processes running as an NT service to  
  be able to talk to a sql db.
</ul>

<h5><a name=bbs>BBS (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> To support a full up community there needs to be an asynchronous
   messaging system or BBS.  It needs to support posting/reading/threading
   of messages, multiple topic areas, admin-only posting areas.
   Requirements include:
       <li> multiple topics, in addition to "only admin can post" topics.
       <li> Message threading.
       <li> Posting of messages by members.
       <li> Reading of messages.
       <li> Show me new messages since I was last on.
       <li> Email notification of new messages (not in r167).
       <li> Admin requirements: delete/archive msgs, add/remove conference, manage user base.
<li> Currently using webboard 2.0 in r167, though BBS userid and EC id are separate.
<li> Ideally, integrate EC Identity.
<li> Consider using WebBoard 3.0: it has support for external databases.
<li> Unknown estimate, unknown if this is even doable.
</ul>

<h5><a name=install>Installer for realm, pls, repository server, db schemas, etc (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> To support a shippable product we need installers for all the pieces.
<li> Not in r167, though we have a windows based installer for the non-hub version of 
  the product.
</ul>

<h5><a name=plsstats>PLS Statistics (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> During the alpha test it became apparent that we need some level of statistics from the PLS.
<li> Currently in r167, though stats seem weak.
<li> required for production level operations.
<li> current statistics not effective: "unregister" is not implemented resulting in vague numbers.
</ul>

<h5><a name=configtool>Configuration and startup tool (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> Currently, configuration is done by tweaking text files containing 
  Java properties.  To support a ship-able product, configuration
  needs to be presented in a coherent and clear user interface.
  <a href=http://www-int/engineering/OldStuff/neocosm/hub/HubManagement.html>http://www-int/engineering/OldStuff/neocosm/hub/HubManagement.html</a> describes the current process for configuring and starting the hub and pls.
<li> Not in r167, nice to have
<li> Sets startup properties.
<li> Should be able to modify configuration of running system.
<li> Very detailed application: may need to take into account "dependent" configuration items.
<li> Details unknown at this time; need to design other subsystems first.
<li> We could design a "configuration" framework that is generalized.
<li> unknown estimate
</ul>

<h5><a name=realmtools>Realm/Region maintenance tools (Priority 3)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> Late in the current cosm we surmised that we needed a mechanism 
  to migrate regions from one machine to another.  If we design the
  "realm description" mechanism correctly, then we can skip this 
  requirement.
<li> Not in r167, nice to have.
<li> Required for splitting regions in one realm across multiple realms/machines.
<li> If we design realm-text (realm description file) correctly, this tool isn't necessary.
</ul>

<h5><a name=mbrbrowser>Membership browser (Priority 4)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> Given that the realm/hub has members, there needs to be a way 
  for a world manager to manually tweak individual members.  For 
  example we might want to put the "ban" functionality in this context.
<li> Not in r167, nice to have.  Depends on how we do membership.
<li> Required for full up community support.
<li> Use off-the-shelf LDAP directory browser if possible.
<li> Ban/Unban is dependent on realm.
</ul>

<h5><a name=mbrreports>Membership report tool (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> Given a full up community, the owner needs some mechanism to 
  realize benefit from running the community.  This reports on information
  derived from the membership and realm/region usage.  In addition, we
  might want to consider providing information separately to hub managers
  and hub owners.  Ie, treat managers and owners as two distinct users
  of the information.
<li> Not in r167, though we have a crude tool to digest logs into usage graphs
<li> Required for community management
</ul>

<h5><a name=events>Schedule of events (Priority 3)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> Simple web page would work, though it would be nice if the schedule had
  automatic notification to members of upcoming events, or maybe only events
  that the member is interested in.
<li> Not in r167, though we use a simple web page
<li> Nice to have: Automatically notify members X days in advance of upcoming events.
</ul>

<h5><a name=realmstatus>External access to Realm/Region Current User Count, aka Realm Status Object (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> This is a "realm" task.  Essentially it amounts to implementing and exposing a 
  "status" object that allows access to interesting information contained within 
  the realm.  Access to the "status object" would be closely held.
<li> Not in r167 (r167 has "where is everyone" which shows user counts.  This is
  only available from within the application.
<li> Required for external status tools, avatar density map
</ul>

<h5><a name=remotecontrol>Remote Control Tool, Lightweight Status Tool (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> This is a tool to access the proposed "realm status object".
<li> Ideally, the hub console should just be a remote tool.  Ie, "console mode" commands
     are 100% available from a remote application.
<li> Not in r167; spec'd but not implemented.
<li> Currently, r167 status/shutdown/restart is difficult.
<li> Proposal: implement command line version supporting an initial command (eg shutdown).
<li> Dependent on comm and pls working.
<li> Dependent on "External access to Realm/region current user count".
</ul>

<h5><a name=entrylog>Realm/Region avatar entry exit log (aka system event log) (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> This is a simple flat file that contains a log record of when an avatar 
  enters the realm, leaves the realm, enters a region, and leaves a region.
  In addition, it contains realm start/stop log records.  We use a simple 
  parser to create usage graphs from the log info.  Heavily documented
  in <a href=http://www-int/engineering/OldStuff/neocosm/hub/HubEventLog.html>http://www-int/engineering/OldStuff/neocosm/hub/HubEventLog.html</a>.
<li> In r167.
<li> Should take a couple days to convert it over to neocosm.
</ul>

<h5><a name=bankickpin>Ban/Kick/Pin (Priority 3)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> To run a community, complete with problem members, some mechanism is required
  in order to restore order when things get out of hand.  One such mechanism is the 
  ability to kick people out, and prevent them from returning, and/or signing up a new id.
  Any method must rely on a scarce resource: money, email addresses, etc.  
  Unfortunately, with a free service this is difficult.
<li> Not in r167; required to run a full-up community.
<li> This task is probably related to the realm and region, and potentially related to the magic wand tool.
</ul>

<h5><a name=magicwand>Magic Wand tools (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> The magic wand tool is a tool to enable remote editing of a region.  Currently,
   the property sheet in the region is the way a user makes changes to the region.
   Since hosting === ownership, we limited access to the property sheet only to
   the avatar that is hosted where the property sheet's object is hosted.  Unfortunately,
   this is untenable for a "lights out" hub (ie a hub that is hosted on a machine in
   a computer room somewhere).  With the "lights out" hub, the world manager 
   needs to make changes remotely.  Since the world manager's avatar is not
   hosted on that hub, we need a tool to allow the world manager avatar (and only the
   world manager avatar) to make remote changes.
<li> Partially in r167.
</ul>

<h5><a name=userlabels>User class labels (helper, acolyte, manager, etc.) (Priority 3)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> With a full up community it is essential to delegate some of the world mgmt
   functions to volunteers.  There is likely no way to support such a community with
   paid staff.  To do this, the community (or the world manager) needs to be able
   to designate who the volunteer helpers are, and be able to label the 
   volunteers.  The ideal way to do this is with certificates that have in-world
   manifestation, and enable the certificate holders to have additional powers.
   I'm not clear why we dot have certificate based avatar labels.  A second
   proposal was to do avatar labels with the member db.
<li> Not in r167.
<li> Required for full-up community support.
<li> Assume simple design where we add labels to the member db or directory.
<li> Requires design.
<li> Probably affects address book, main window (mouse over), member db, directory, realm, region, avatar.
</ul>

<h5><a name=whoson>Who's on now in this realm (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> r167 has a feature off the region watermark that opens a window containing
  a list of all the avatars in the realm, and the region that each avatar is in.  This is
  useful for finding out who's around, and where they are.
<li> Already in r167.
<li> r167 missing "teleport to avatar".
<li> Essential feature for turf, hub.
<li> Dependent on realm, region, application ui.
</ul>

<h5><a name=pagehelper>Page turf owner, helper, acolyte, etc. (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> To support customers by using volunteer staff there needs to be a way
  for customers to contact a support person/volunteer.  Ideally, there should
  be a "pool" of helpers within a given world that are "on duty" and will
  receive pages.  In the case of  the "turf" product, there needs to be a 
  way for visitors to contact the turf owner.
  This feature essentially invokes a telepathy conversation.
<li> Not in r167.
<li> Required for full up community.
<li> Dependent on realm/region/directory, probably speech ui.
<li> Need ui design
</ul>

<h5><a name=broadcast>Broadcast to everyone in the realm (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> It would be useful for the turf or realm owner to be able to broadcast a  
  message from the turf or realm everyone in the realm.  An example is 
  event announcement.   I'm not sure if it makes sense to be able to 
  broadcast to everyone in all realms.
<li> Not in r167.
<li> Required for full up community.
<li> Dependent on realm/region, speech ui
</ul>

<h5><a name=realmentrypolicies>Realm Entry Policies (Priority 2)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> To support a limited access community where entry requirements 
   are placed on the users, it is necessary to have a framework
   in place to support the implementation of realm entry policies.
   Policies include:
     <ul>
     <li> Depending on hub-side status of entering avatar's account, a url
       is sent to the user.  (in r167, works, not fully rung out.)
     <li> Avatar must be registered.
     <li> Avatar not banned in hub/realm.
     <li> Avatar limits, eg only X number of avatars in region.
          (Fix bug: turf owner is alowed to enter regardless of avatar limit.)
     <li> Turf/hub is open.  Implies that realm has a "closed" state.  Only the 
        owning avatar can enter when the realm is "closed".
     <li> In address book, avatar is set for "allowed to visit turf". (turf only)
     </ul>
<li> Currently in r167.  See requirements for details.
<li> Required for full up community that is "closed" and limits access.
<li> Take these requirements into account when designing realm
</ul>

<h5><a name=realmentryplugin>Programmatic Realm Entry check (Priority 3)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> We probably want to make realm entry checking as dynamic and extensible
   as possible.  By supporting an interface for external code (or script) to 
   execute, we can allow the world owner to implement powerful mechanisms
   for authorizing avatar entry to the world.  An example might be directing a 
   returning user to a web page to fill out a one time form.  What's proposed here
  is essentially a Realm interface that allows plug-in code to do custom world 
  entry checking based on entering identity.  Might have security implications: 
  its a security problem if  world operators start passing around their plug-ins.
<li> Not in r167.
<li> Nice to have, but if done correctly would differentiate us from others.
<li> Need better spec: this is something that hub customers would see.
</ul>

<h5><a name=tickets>"Ticket" certificates for entry authorization. (Priority 3)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> Not in r167.  was in initial spec.
<li> Nice to have; would facilitate lighter weight realm entry and differentiate us from others.
<li> Need spec.
</ul>

<h5><a name=inworldpush>In world "Push" mechanism (Priority unknown)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> [I'm not sure what this entails.  Someone needs to spec requriements.]
<li> Not in r167.
<li> Nice to have, especially for marketing purposes.
<li> Need spec.
</ul>

<h5><a name=map>Map, in-model rendering (Priority 4)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> In r167 we use the web browser to present the map.
<li> Nice to have: in-model rendering of map image; using web browser is too jarring.
<li> unknown estimate.
</ul>

<h5><a name=avatardensities>Avatar densities on map (Priority 4)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> This is a feature that was triaged from the early spec.  The idea here is to
  show where in the realm avatars are, and do it in a graphical way.
<li> Not in r167.
<li> Nice to have, especially for thriving communities.
<li> Where is everyone satisfies this to some degree, but that tool requires entry into the world.
<li> If we just tack this on to the web page maps, and assuming we have realm status,
this would be somewhat straightforward.
</ul>

<h5><a name=ecurl>EC:// href urls (Priority 1)</a></h5>
<ul>
<li> Not really a hub requirement per se.
<li> We currently have an .mcm file that contains either teleport information
  or avatar address book information.  Its possible for these files to be placed
  on the web such that they are "clickable" in a web browser, and will launch
  microcosm.  The use of .mcm  file requires settings on the web server side, 
  hence it might not be possible for some users to use this feature: it requires 
  access to the web server.  A totally web _client_ centric mechanism for 
  specifying a "web link" to a microcosm region, or address book page, would  
  only require users to add the link to the html page.  The proposal tossed
  around is to use ec:// in the standard URL query string format to support this.
<li> MCM file launching currently in r167.
<li> This is how we launch from a web page into cosm.
<li> We should have ec:// urls which would eliminate the need for web server side
  functionality that currently generates the mcm file contents.
<li> Essential if we want to allow individuals to refer to their turfs from their web pages.
<li> Requires changes to cosm launch process.
<li> Requires web browser DDE/OLE hooks.
</ul>

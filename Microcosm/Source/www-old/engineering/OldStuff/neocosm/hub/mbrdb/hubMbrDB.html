<h1>Hub Member Database</h1>

<p><b>Last updated:</b><i> [98/05/18 Jeff]</i> </p>

<p>Author: Jeff Crilly, <a href="mailto:jeff@communities.com">jeff@communities.com</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Hub Member DB is a database wrapper which provides high
level access to a database schema implemented using an
off-the-shelf database product. The database is &quot;hub
only&quot;; there is no implementation on the
&quot;habiturf&quot; product. However, the design is modular,
such that enabling the member db on the &quot;gui habiturf&quot;
version is doable.</p>

<p>The highlevel wrapper api provides asynchronous access to the
MemberDB schema using E objects, and provides a mechanism for the
realm to verify that a given avatar identity exists in the member
db, and the identity is allowed to enter the realm.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a web based &quot;avatar
registration&quot; mechanism for hub users to add their avatars
to the member database.</p>

<p>The member db architecture is designed to support multiple
underlying database engines. Two are supported: CodeBase (a
flat-file xbase compatible db engine on windows) and JDBC. For
the JDBC implementation, SqlServer is currently supported,
however the JDBC SQL code is generic enough to support other
RDBMS. On the JDBC side, the JDK provided JDBC/ODBC bridge is
used. Again, other JDBC drivers should work, the only change
required is a property that specifies the driver and database
URL.</p>

<p>The key feature that the Hub Member DB provides is the ability
to prevent &quot;banned&quot; avatars from entering the hub. This
is accomplished partially by the database schema and partially by
the hub realm una.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Current Architecture Overview</h4>

<p>The best way to explain the architecture is through the use of
some diagrams. </p>

<h5>Realm - Member DB - Off the shelf database relationship</h5>

<p>The following diagram shows the components and message flows
between the Realm una and the underlying database implementation.
(Note: This is a draft picture; there is some simplification.)</p>

<h5>Hub-o-cosm - Habi-cosm - Web - Database relationship</h5>

<p>The other item worth mentioning at this level is the
relationship between the hub, habi*, and the web. This is shown
in the following diagram.</p>

<p><img src="highlevelhubweb.GIF" width="670" height="417"></p>

<p>Note: The above diagram shows relationships between the
systems. Double ended arrows indicate bi-directional flows.
Specific messages are identified in following sections and
diagrams.</p>

<h5>Avatar entry dataflow</h5>

<p>The following diagram depicts the process data flow that
occurs when an avatar is registered with the MemberDB and tries
to enter the world. The Avatar identity is found in the Member
DB, and the avatar can enter the world.</p>

<p><img src="avatarchecksuccess.GIF" width="614" height="385"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Avatar registration</h5>

<p>The following diagram shows the flow when an entering avatar's
identity is not registered in the Member DB. In this case, the
avatar entry will fail, and the user will be sent to a web page
that will enable the user to register the current avatar
identity. The web page is specified by the &quot;registration
URL&quot;. This URL contains a query string value which will
dynamically create the registration page from the database
content. (The implementation for creating the page is web server
and database dependent. For the MS IIS/SqlServer implementation
the implementation is Active Server Pages (ASP). A &quot;C&quot;
CGI version also exists for the CodeBase version.) When the user
submits the avatar registration form, the form's field contents
are processed by server-side code. If the avatar is added to the
account, then a &quot;success&quot; page is sent back to the
browser. If the avatar cannot be added to the account (e.g. the
account password is incorrect, or the account is
&quot;closed&quot;), then the form is sent back to the user with
an appropriate error message.</p>

<h5>Supported database engines</h5>

<p>Another important aspect of the hub member db is its use of
the off-the-shelf database component. The current implementation
supports Sequiter CodeBase and MS SqlServer. Other SQL RDBMSs
should work; its just a matter of defining the MemberDB schema,
and any neccessary stored procedures. The difference between
these two DB engines is cost, flexibility, and
ease-of-integration. CodeBase is no-royalty and made sense for
the &quot;hub&quot; application we were productizing. However,
CodeBase is not relational, its difficult to define a multi-table
schema, and CodeBase doesn't easily integrate with other web
applications. ('C' CGI is the only way to talk to it.) SqlServer
carries a hefty price tag, but intregates easily with the java
based hub code using JDBC and other web applications. For
example, on the MS IIS web server, Active Server Pages directly
support Active Data Objects which provide access to ODBC data
sources. (Note: CodeBase was the first DB engine to get
integrated. Its possible that the higher level implementation has
drifted a bit, which require some adjustment to the CodeBase
wrapper.)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tables<ul>
            <li>Acct - holds the basic account info: Login,
                Password, email addr</li>
            <li>Persons - holds information about the acct
                holder: Name, real address, phone, etc</li>
            <li>Identities - avatars that have registered and are
                members of the hub</li>
            <li>NewIdentities - a holding area for identities
                that are attempting to register</li>
            <li>FailUrls - a small table containing URLs. When an
                avatar entry fails, one of these URLs is sent
                back to the user. The failure URL is specified by
                avatar in the Identities table.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Unique Keys and Foriegn Keys<ul>
            <li>The Acct table specifies an auto generated unique
                key for each acct record. This key is used as a
                foreign key in the Persons and Identities tables.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Relationships<ul>
            <li>Acct -&gt; Persons : One to One</li>
            <li>Acct -&gt; Identities : One to Many</li>

<h4>Proposed Architecture Overview</h4>

<p><i>This section is not urgent for the first version of this
document, you should capture what direction you feel this
subsystem ought to take. As we start addressing specific systems
this section will grow into the core of the design document.</i> </p>

<p>(Draft Draft Draft) A couple items worth considering..</p>

<ol>
    <li>Avatar registration seems a bit clunky. Originally, we
        were designing without the requirement of a password
        protected web site. It seems that if we are requiring a
        login/password to access the web site, then why do we
        need to &quot;register&quot; avatars? The answer is that
        with just the web site login/password we can't prevent
        someone from entering the world (eg, if we ban the
        person). For example, the user may have a teleport
        reference to the world, which currently can't be revoked.
        We need some form of &quot;dis-access&quot; and the
        member db provides this.</li>
    <li>There should be a simpler way for accessing external
        databases from within an una. The initial design for the
        member db took a direction to isolate the guest code as
        much as possible from the crew code. Hence, the API at
        the steward level was centered around the application,
        i.e., the member db. Another approach would be to
        implement a generic RDBMS access mechanism, which would
        allow guest code access to any tables, and specify any
        query. Clearly, there is an issue defining what the
        granularity (if any) of access should be, if any, and by
        capability. If we limit access to capabilities by table,
        or query, then the complexity goes up. In the original
        spec, this complexity was unjustified. However, we may
        want to consider an alternate architecture that allows
        more liberal access to an external database.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Off the shelf alternatives</h4>

<p>The Member DB implementation utilizes off-the-shelf database
engines. The future product should just support RDBMS that
support SQL.</p>

<h4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

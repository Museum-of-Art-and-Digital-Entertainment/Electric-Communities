<H1>Data Repository</H1>

<P><B>Last updated:</B><I> [98/06/16 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>]</I>
</P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The current data repository has many problems, both in implementation
and interface. The purpose of this document is to capture a simpler, layered
architecture for managing the resources in the data repository that meets
the needs of its clients (runtime and production). </P>

<H4>Related Documents</H4>

Randy's memory of the original spec through the latest thoughts from the
Bob&amp;Bill show to a first cut at the new design by <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A>.

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>The data repository should provide: </P>

<P>1. Efficient retrieval of blobs of data both as byte arrays and streams.
<BR>
2. Simple API for adding and retrieving data blobs, and some way of removing
&quot;stale&quot; data. <BR>
3. Caching strategies so that single instances of data blobs are loaded
and managed without intervention by the clients. <BR>
4. Mapping of name spaces onto data blobs (most likely name to cryptohash
mapping). </P>

<H4>Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>

<P>The services provided by the new repository are a superset of the previous
version, but they are layered into smaller, more manageable and general
components. </P>

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>

<P>Some of the new functions in the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java.lang.ClassLoader.html">1.2
Classloader</A> may be applicable to a generalized resource manager. </P>

<H2>Design Issues</H2>

<H4>Resolved Issues</H4>

<P><I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I> </P>

<H4>Open Issues</H4>

<P>[<I>98/05/29 <A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com" original-href="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A></I>]
I am presuming that the primary resource type will be data stored in the
repository and that the cryptohash method of lookup is sufficient. In the
current system, the only place that the name-to-cryptohash translation
is done is during realm-text parsing. For the production case, where we
want filename lookup to succeed, initially I am ignoring caching completely,
since it is a debug mode feature. If we end up with a generalized caching
mechanism that will support caching the filename case easily, then we should
use it, but I am unwilling to state it as a requirement given the scope
of work we still have to do. </P>

<P>[98/06/18 Bill] I get the impression that alpha testers are hacking
their realm text files. If this is an important part of the user experience,
then we will probably need to deliver the name to cryptohash binding in
the customer system. We could also deliver it as an extra cost item depending
on product development's requirements.</P>

<H2>
Introduction</H2>
Containment is the most basic application-level protocol for Microcosm.&nbsp;
We are calling it an application protocol since it implements a particular
set of semantics for Microcosm virtual world objects, and it doesn't have
an infrastructure piece of its own--it leverages both the proxy comm and
the DObjects infrastructures.

<P>Containment will be implemented as one of the basic Components in the
prototypical Microcosm CompositeDObject world objects.&nbsp; That is, there
will be some prototype CompositeDObject which is the "canonical prop" if
you will; the Containment component will be the most basic component thereof.

<P>NOTE THAT I AM CHANGING THE WORD FOR THIS FROM CONTAINERSHIP TO CONTAINMENT!&nbsp;
"Containment" is far more grammatically correct than "containership".

<P>Notational conventions:&nbsp; [<B><U>Issues for reviewers are in bold

Architecture</H2>

<H3>
Current Architecture Overview</H3>
The <A HREF="protocol1v5.html">oldocosm containership protocol document</A>
is the best extant description of the old protocol.&nbsp; It is none too
current (it lacks all discussion of the presence spread fixes) but it gives
some indication of the complexity of the full multi-level approach to containership.
<H3>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H3>
The particular design proposal put forth here has the following characteristics
(in terms of the above documents' discussions):
<OL>
<LI>
Implements the multi-level containment world behavior needed for Microcosm.</LI>

<LI>
Stores all multi-level containment state only at the "region level" or
"root container level".&nbsp; (i.e. this is a "single-level approach to
multi-level containment" in the parlance of the <A HREF="Introduction.htm">containment
introduction</A>.)</LI>

<LI>
Leverages the DObjects infrastructure for all client presence creation
and messaging and all container membership tracking.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
A note on Facets</H4>
There are two types of relationships between the DObjects in this design:
<OL>
<LI>
DObjectFacets are facets created and maintained by the Session infrastructure.&nbsp;
If a Containable is present in a Space, it will generally have DObjectFacets
that allow it to interact with that Space and with the other Containables
therein.</LI>

<LI>
EFacets are facets implemented via the point-to-point E infrastructure.&nbsp;
EFacets are used to implement protocols between DObjects where there is
not yet any preexisting Session containing both DObjects.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
Spaces and Containables defined</H4>
The proposed architecture defines two classes of objects:
<UL>
<LI>
Spaces: these are objects which define and manage a space containing a
nested tree of sub-objects.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The Space object is responsible for setting and enforcing TOS; it also
tracks all state relating to the contents of the space.&nbsp; That is,
only the Space object contains information about the direct contents of
the Space itself, or about the contents of any open sub-containers within
the Space.</LI>

<LI>
Sub-containers within the Space do <I>not</I> keep track of their own contents;
they delegate that completely to the Space.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Containables: these are objects which may be contained within a Space.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Note that Containables are never Spaces themselves <I>from the point of
view of their current containing Space</I>.</LI>

<LI>
Containables have access to their containing Space, and can interact with
the other members of the Space.</LI>

<LI>
Containables <I>may</I> have a reference to their containing object.&nbsp;
More on this in the disconnection discussion.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Digression into closable containers:&nbsp; A Containable may have a Space
that it maintains; for example, an openable/closable container, while closed,
may act as a "private Space" for its contents.&nbsp; But from the point
of view of the Space in which the openable/closable container resides,
the container while closed is simply another containable, with no known
contents.)</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
It almost certainly makes sense to implement two different Components:&nbsp;
the Containable component (contained by CompositeDObjects which act as
containables), and the Space component (contained by CompositeDObjects
which act as Spaces).&nbsp; Openable/closable containers could be CompositeDObjects
with both sorts of component.&nbsp; (Note that this is different from the
oldocosm code, which lumps both functionalities into the single mind-bogglingly
huge containership ingredient.)
<H4>
The ContainmentSessionManager</H4>
There is one additional infrastructural object defined by the containment
subsystem:
<UL>
<LI>
The ContainmentSessionManager is a singleton factory object which manages
the containment-related SessionMembers on a particular process.&nbsp; The
ContainmentSessionManager is responsible for providing Session access to
individual host DObjects..</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
All Space host DObjects, on construction, receive a capability from the
ContainmentSessionManager which they can use to instantiate a new SessionServer.</LI>

<LI>
All Containable host DObjects, on construction, receive a capability from
the ContainmentSessionManager which they can use to request to be added
to a Session with a given ID.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The ContainmentSessionManager may connect them directly (if that Session
happens to be local) or may construct a SessionMemberClient, connect it,
and then add the DObject to that SessionMemberClient.&nbsp; In either case
the Containable knows nothing about the distribution of the Session.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>

<H4>
Spaces</H4>
Here is an overview of the state of a Space.&nbsp; (Most of this is probably
too verbose and should get deprecated in favor of the pseudocode.&nbsp;
What do you think?)
<OL>
<LI>
A plain Java reference to a SessionServer.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The Space, on construction, is given a capability to create a SessionServer
(this capability is provided by the ContainmentSessionManager); it creates
a SessionServer using this capability.</LI>

<LI>
It then uses the SessionServer to:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Create capabilities that other Containable DObjects can use to actually
enter the session.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
These capabilities essentially wrap the SessionServer itself.&nbsp; Remote
Containable DObjects can request their local ContainmentSessionManager
to connect to the specified Session, creating a new SessionMemberClient
if appropriate (which hooks itself up via the session-entry capability).</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Cause particular members of the Space's Session to be evicted if the Space
chooses to do so.</LI>

<LI>
Leverage the SessionServer's membership notification, so that the Space
component needs to keep no information about what Containables are currently
"connected" to the Space.&nbsp; See &lt;&lt;Disconnection/eviction handling>>
below.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<LI>
A tree data structure describing the Space's complete knowledge of the
containment topology of the Space.&nbsp; This corresponds fairly closely
to the data (as opposed to the live references) in the current jRootUnumTree
structure:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
For each Containable, the tree stores that Containable's presentation data,
its location, and its contents.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
An "entry EFacet" which may be published via a SturdyRef.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This entry facet is implemented as a standard E facet--i.e. it is <I>not</I>
a DObjectFacet--since it is used only by objects which are not yet present
in the Space, and therefore which are not part of the Session, and therefore
which cannot yet have DObjectFacets to communicate with the Session.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>
The operations available on a Space are as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
A Space exports a facet that arbitrary Containables can use to request
to be admitted to the Space.</LI>

<LI>
Once admitted, the Space issues (via its SessionServer) DObjectFacets to
each newly-contained Containable DObject.&nbsp; These facets support the
following operations.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
Each admitted Containable can request to leave the Space.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
If it does so, it is analogous to a "disconnect" of that object--i.e. the
presumption is that <I>just that Containable</I> is leaving.&nbsp; What
happens to the children of that DObject (if any) is a policy decision for
the Space.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Each admitted Containable can request that it <I>and/or all its children</I>
be transferred elsewhere.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Note that the destination may or may not be a Space; consider the example
of an open box requesting its containing Pocket (which is a Space) to transfer
it and all its contents to a particular avatar's hand.&nbsp; In this case,
the destination is not a Space, but a Containable-which-is-also-an-open-container-in-another-Space.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Each admitted Containable can request to change its (and only its) presentation.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This is subject to TOS enforcement, of course, and may be refused by the
Space.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Each admitted Containable, finally, can request that a child or set of
children be added beneath it.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Continuing the above example, the avatar, when notified that the open box
wants to be added, would relay that information to its containing Space,
essentially saying "please add this box underneath me."</LI>

<LI>
Another case of this would be a teleport pad, which is a Containable; when
an avatar arrives on the pad, the Containable messages its space saying
"please add this object at this location in the Space."&nbsp; Note that
this is slightly different in that the pad does not request that the avatar
be added <I>as part of the pad's contents;</I> the pad just requests that
the avatar be added to the same container which contains the pad itself.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>
</OL>
The DObjectFacet non-spoofability mechanism is leveraged here to prevent
(say) a given Containable from requesting that a given object be added
as the contents of some completely different Containable, or to prevent
a given Containable from requesting that another Containable be removed
from the Space.
<H4>
Containables</H4>
Here is an overview of the state of a Containable.
<OL>
<LI>
A Containable has a DObjectFacet which it can use to interact with its
containing Space.&nbsp; See above for the operations available on that
reference.</LI>

<LI>
A Containable has a "Container Of Last Resort" sturdy EFacet reference
to an entry facet on a co-hosted DObject (which may be a Containable or
a Space).</LI>

<LI>
A Containable <I>may</I> also have a fragile EFacet to its containing Containable.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
What the hell, let me digress into this right now.&nbsp; The issue is simple:&nbsp;
let's say an avatar creates a rock while standing in a region hosted elsewhere.&nbsp;
Suddenly the avatar's machine (which is also the rock's machine) disconnects
from the region's machine.&nbsp; This means that both the avatar and the
rock vanish from that region (because the region's SessionServer will inform
the region DObject's Space component that those two DObjects are no longer
members of the Session, and the region's Space component will clean up
accordingly.)</LI>

<LI>
But <I>where do the avatar and the rock vanish <B>to</B>?</I>&nbsp; The
avatar never contains any state about its contents, so the avatar can't
tell the rock where the avatar now is (as it does in oldocosm).&nbsp; The
rock could just vanish to its container of last resort--i.e. the avatar's
pocket--but this is very disconcerting to the user.</LI>

<LI>
If the rock, however, has some type of reference (likely fragile) to its
current container DObject, it can--when informed that it is no longer part
of its current Session--use that reference to request that container DObject
to re-add it.&nbsp; Consider this a "current container for purposes of
disconnection handling" reference.&nbsp; This is rather similar to the
persistence technique, where containables keep references to their containers
and use them to re-add on revival; only in this case, the re-adding happens
on disconnection instead, and the reference is not a RecoupableCapability
but just a fragile reference.</LI>

<LI>
All of this is optional; if we decide it's not worth doing at first, then
we will simply be left with everything you hold going to your pocket on
a disconnection.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
A Containable has its presentation state as well, of course, and when visible
in a region it also has a Presenter it can use.&nbsp; This Presenter was
created by its current containing Space, and passed down via the Space's
DObjectFacet.</LI>

<LI>
A Containable also has a SessionMemberDObjectFacet to interact with its
Session, and may also have DObjectFacets to all the other Containables;
these are of course mediated by the SessionMember.</LI>
</OL>
And now the operations of the Containable:
<OL>
<LI>
A Containable can remove itself from its Space, analogous to (but not requiring)
a disconnect.</LI>

<LI>
A Containable can request that its Space add a set of objects "underneath
it" (i.e. an avatar pulling something out of its pocket).</LI>

<LI>
A Containable can request that its Space add a set of objects "alongside
it" (i.e. a teleport pad introducing an avatar).</LI>

<LI>
A Containable can request that its Space transfer a set of its contained
objects to another Containable, which may or may not be in the same Space
(i.e. an openable box closing and transferring all its contents to its
own private Space).</LI>

<LI>
A Containable can request that its Space disconnect a set of objects from
its contents.</LI>

<LI>
A Space can request that the Containable transfer itself to another Space.&nbsp;
This is how sets of objects move; the Space knows that when a parent Containable
goes somewhere, the Space itself has to request all the children of that
parent to go there as well.</LI>
</OL>
All of these, clearly, are implemented basically by pass-throughs to the
DObjectFacet granted to the Containable by its Space.
<H4>
Initial setup protocol</H4>
When an instance of EC Habitats starts up, this proposal assumes that the
revival code simply instantiates a set of host DObject presences on the
local process.&nbsp; The assumption is that only DObjects are revived;
there is no notion of reviving a Session.

<P>When a Space DObject is revived, it immediately creates a SessionServer
instance to manage the DObjects that are about to arrive in that Space.&nbsp;
It is then done with its initialization.

<P>When a Containable DObject is revived, it obtains two things:
<UL>
<LI>
an EFacet which it can use to request entry to its "saved container."&nbsp;
(It may acquire this facet by following a SturdyRef, or by using the current
RecoupableCapability mechanism; the end result is the same.)</LI>

<LI>
a capability to the ContainmentSessionManager which it can use to request
access to a particular Session.</LI>
</UL>
Once it has that entry EFacet reference, the following protocol commences:
<OL>
<LI>
The Containable sends information about itself (its pstate and its initially
requested location) to the entry EFacet.</LI>

<LI>
The entry EFacet may have been published by a Space or by a Containable.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
If it is to a Space, then the Space performs its TOS check on the entering
Containable.&nbsp; Assuming it passes, the Space creates a capability to
allow another Session to join the Space's Session.&nbsp; It passes this
session-join capability, along with the Space's SessionID, back to the
Containable.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
The Containable then passes the SessionID and the session-join capability
to its local ContainmentSessionManager.</LI>

<LI>
The ContainmentSessionManager looks up the SessionID; if it is known, the
ContainmentSessionManager returns that SessionMember--otherwise it creates
a new SessionMemberClient and passes it the session-join capability, which
allows the SessionMemberClient to connect.</LI>

<LI>
At this point, the normal SessionMember->DObject setup protocol takes over,
and the Containable becomes truly part of the Session, including receiving
DObjectFacets to the Space.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Note that the Session setup may involve further round trips.&nbsp; In some
sense this is a two-step protocol; first you dereference the DObject you
are entering, then you can enter the Session itself.&nbsp; It would be
nice to be able to optimize this by pipelining the session setup on the
entry request, so the round trips wouldn't be necessary.&nbsp; More thought
is needed here.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>

<LI>
If it is to a Containable, then that Containable needs to forward the entry
request to its Space.&nbsp; However, since we are discussing initial setup,
that Containable may itself not be connected to a Space yet.&nbsp; In that
case, the Containable queues the request until its own initial entry is
complete.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
Once the Containable being added to is itself in a Space, it forwards the
entry request to its DObjectFacet to its Space; the request is "add this
sub-Containable as a containment child of me."</LI>

<LI>
The protocol then proceeds essentially as above; the Space performs a TOS
check, issues a capability that the original Containable can use to join
the Session, and so forth.</LI>
</OL>
</OL>
</OL>
This protocol also applies not just at revival but post-revival, for essentially
any entry by a Containable into a new Space (i.e. a Space where the containable
was not already present--for more on the case where it <I>is</I> already
present, see below).

<P>Note that the more important case above is in many ways the Containable
case.&nbsp; Take two examples:
<OL>
<LI>
Teleport pads are Containables whose SturdyRefs are accessible over the
network.&nbsp; When a teleport pad gets contacted with a request to allow
an avatar to teleport in, the teleport pad goes through the "If it is a
Containable..." protocol above, relaying the request to its containing
Space.&nbsp; Essentially the pad is saying "Here I am, a teleport pad already
contained by a space... I now request the space to add this avatar right
on top of me."</LI>

<LI>
Avatars are Containables which have a close connection to their pocket,
a privately held Space.&nbsp; When an avatar takes something out of its
pocket, the thing coming out of the pocket requests the Avatar to contain
it.&nbsp; The Avatar then forwards that request to its containing Space,
essentially saying "Here I am, an avatar already contained by a space...
I now request the space to add this object to my hand."</LI>
</OL>
Most containment interactions are between Containables, except for initial
entry into a Space and putting something "on the floor" or otherwise directly
into a Space.

<P>??? slotted semantics go here ???&nbsp; how do you get the presence
soon enough to leverage its semantics?!?!?

<P>Entry key information should be fleshed out here!

<P>Diagram.
<H4>
Disconnection/eviction handling</H4>

<H5>
Space handling of disconnection</H5>
Once a Space has admitted some Containables, it then needs to keep its
local containment tree synchronized with the membership of its associated
ServerSessionMember.

<P>The Space's containment tree is the only data structure storing information
about hierarchical containment relationships.&nbsp; The ServerSessionMember
tracks just "flat" membership information--i.e. a plain set of DObjects
that are currently participating in the Session.&nbsp; The ServerSessionMember
knows nothing about which DObjects contain which.

<P>When a remote SessionMember disconnects, or when a DObject (local or
remote) disconnects itself from the Session, the ServerSessionMember detects
it.&nbsp; The ServerSessionMember then notifies the Space of that change
in membership, via the ordinary membership-change notification mechanism
in the SessionMember.&nbsp; The Space DObject then must decide what to
do to update its containment tree.&nbsp; Some options include:
<UL>
<LI>
Objects contained by the departed object all "fall to the floor"--i.e.
are now all contained by the Space itself.&nbsp; (In this case, if the
avatar disconnects while holding something hosted by the Space's machine,
the avatar will reappear in its home turf empty-handed, and the thing it
was holding will fall on the floor.)</LI>

<LI>
Objects contained by the departed object are notified that they should
attempt to reconnect to their last-known container.&nbsp; (In this case,
if the avatar disconnects while holding something hosted by another machine,
that something would be told "Try to reconnect to the avatar if you can
reach it.")</LI>

<LI>
Objects contained by the departed object are kicked back to their container
of last resort.&nbsp; (The above two cases may both devolve to this as,
well, a last resort.)</LI>
</UL>

<H5>
Containable handling of disconnection</H5>
From the Containable side, it is notified of direct disconnection or eviction
via the same mechanism:&nbsp; its SessionMemberDObjectFacet getting revoked.&nbsp;
This will happen if either
<OL>
<LI>
the Space evicts it, or</LI>

<LI>
its SessionMember becomes disconnected from the remote SessionMember.</LI>
</OL>
In either case, the Containable attempts to re-enter its "last known container".&nbsp;
If this fails, it re-enters its container of last resort (which is guaranteed
to succeed by definition).

<P>If the Containable's container goes away, the Space will be responsible
for informing the Containable.&nbsp; The Containable must then respond--either
by trying to reenter its last known container (which it may still be able
to reach), or by simply updating its local knowledge of its position within
the Space.
<H4>
Transfer protocol</H4>
Basic transfer order.
<BR>Constraints.
<BR>The magic of keys!!!&nbsp; <B><U>OK, THIS IS THE NEXT THING TO FIGURE
OUT.</U></B>
<OL>
<LI>
First the containable requests the Space to transfer it, passing some type
of reference to the destination Containable.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This reference may or may not be a DObjectFacet since the destination Containable
may or may not be in the same Space.&nbsp; It's not clear whether we want
to have just one type of "destination Containable" reference here.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
The Space then marks the Containable and all its children as "in transit"
and sends a message (containing the entire state of that subtree, including
the keys by which the Containables are known to the Space) to the destination
Containable.</LI>

<LI>
The destination Containable routes this message to its current Space.</LI>

<LI>
That destination Space compares keys.&nbsp; If the keys are already present,
the destination Space just rejiggers its tree and signals success.&nbsp;
(This is the transfer-within-Space case.)</LI>

<LI>
That destination Space does its TOS checking.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
If the destination Containable is also in transit, what happens???&nbsp;
Perhaps the transfer simply doesn't occur?&nbsp; Error message???&nbsp;
Or does the destination Space just hold onto the request until the transit
of the destination Containable succeeds (in which case it probably just
tells the destination Containable to resubmit its request to its new Space),
or fails (in which case it goes ahead and adds the requested new Containables
underneath the destination Containable).</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
If the destination Space allows the objects, the destination Space updates
its containment tree with information about the new containables.&nbsp;
The new containables are marked as "arriving" (i.e. they are shimmering
or something).</LI>

<LI>
The destination Space then mints "enter-my-Session" capabilities for all
of them and calls directly back to the originating Space, passing those
capabilities.</LI>

<LI>
The originating Space then updates its tree to remove the objects (also
signaling any pending operations on that in-transit tree to be resubmitted
in the context of the new Space), and tells all the objects to transfer
to the new Space's Session, using the "enter-my-Session" capabilities that
the destination Space passed to it.</LI>

<LI>
Once the destination Space gets informed by its SessionServer that the
arriving Containables have actually arrived in the Session, it unmarks
them as "arriving" since they are now fully present.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>
A more precise specification</H3>
I need a way to get more precise about how I envision the protocol functioning.&nbsp;
Here's my first shot:&nbsp; a draft of the relevant classes (with their
state and their interfaces), and then a detailed pseudocode-ish walkthrough
of the protocol and the relevant object states.

Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H3>
<I>Lists any special objectives and assumptions of the code e.g. reusability,
thread safety, security, performance, use of resources, compatibility with
existing code etc. This section gives important context for reviewers</I>
<H2>
Current implementation</H2>
<I>This section should give details of the major classes and interfaces.</I>
<H4>
Which packages on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
<I>For example ec4/javasrc/ec/...</I>
<H4>
Implementation overview</H4>
<I>In many cases, this section can link to JavaDoc output from actual Java
classes and interfaces. This saves writing documentation twice (the designers
will have to JavaDoc their interfaces anyway). The JavaDoc should be linked
into the design document. <A HREF="../tools/javadoc.html">Chip's JavaDoc
style guidelines</A> explain how to use JavaDoc effectively.</I>
<H4>
Exception handling</H4>
<I>For any clients of the subsystem this section discusses in general the
exceptions that this subsystem can throw in usage, this section should
also link to the corresponding JavaDoc.</I>
<H4>
Examples</H4>
<I>Are there examples?</I>
<H4>
Performance</H4>
<I>Lists performance issues, targets, considerations and tradeoffs for
this subsystem. These issues can include: class bloat, runtime resource
consumption and usage/invocation cost. Here are some questions to consider:</I>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Is this code doing the minimum possible for TheProduct?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>Could this code be native?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>Should this code be native?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>What do you see as the most likely performance bottlenecks in this code?</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>Is there another way to write them so they're not bottlenecks?</I></LI>
</UL>

<H4>
Testing Strategy and Debugging</H4>
<I>Describes the testing strategy for this subsystem. List if it is possible
to stress test this code outside TheProduct. Lists the testing API, any
tests and debugging utilities which are to be developed to help test the
design (e.g. test classes, trace categories, etc.).</I>
<H4>
Interactions and dependencies with other subsystems</H4>
<I>Describes the testing strategy for this subsystem. Lists any tests and
debugging utilities which are to be developed to help test the design (e.g.
test classes, trace categories, etc.)</I>
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Design Issues</H2>

<H4>
Resolved Issues</H4>
<I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I>
<H4>
Open Issues</H4>
<I>This section of the document is used by the authors and moderator to
store any incomplete information - issues identified during a design inspection
but not yet resolved (the task list), notes that aren't ready to be put
into the main text, etc.</I>

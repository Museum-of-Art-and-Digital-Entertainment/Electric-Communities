<H2>Overview</H2>
This document is not meant to be a detailed analysis of the renderer subsystem. Any
such analysis should be based on the <A HREF="RendererSubsystem.html">
renderer documentation</A>. This document is simply geared towards answering the
question: "Should we stick with the AnyChannel renderer?" It will also list, very
briefly, the pieces of our architecture that would be affected by switching renderers.	

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

We should stick with the AnyChannel renderer. Moving to another native renderer 
would present the same issues as the AnyChannel renderer, but would cost us more 
money, and there's no telling what new problems might occur. Moving to a Java-only
renderer seems premature, both in terms of stability and performance. Sun's new
offering, Java3D, is in its first release, and it sits on top of OpenGL, which is
notoriously slow in software. It doesn't seem wise to commit to a solution that
will work only on 3D-accelerated machines.
<P>

<H2>Pieces that would be affected by a renderer swap</H2>

<H3>Scene package</H3>
Mike is currently cleaning this up to make it more general, but this is the piece that
would be most dramatically impacted if we changed renderers. Ideally the renderer
interface wouldn't have to change much, but that would depend entirely on how similar
the new renderer was to AnyChannel. At the very least, we'd need to write a Java wrapper
for the new renderer.

<H3>Dynamo3D</H3>
This code is slated to be re-written. It currently talks directly to the renderer and
would definitely need to be reworked to integrate with a new renderer.

<H3>EcFonts</H3>
As I understand it, the bitmaps that ECFonts creates need to be handed to the renderer 
for rendering in the GUI plane.

<H3>SceneWidget</H3>
This piece is responsible for creating custom UI elements and asking the renderer 
to draw them.

<H2>Issues</H2>

<H3>AnyChannel renderer maintenance</H3>
<I>How hard is it to maintain the AnyChannel renderer? 
Is it fair to say that that work is mostly done?</I>
<P>
<B>RussP:</B>
<P>
I'll break this down into three areas.
<P>
The first I'll call maintenance caused by higher level code using new
functionality.  This component was very small.  Whenever Mike or Harry
(and this was mostly Harry) would do something new and the renderer
would change to support the new thing, there was a period of
instability.  However, this very quickly converged to stability.
<P>
The second I'll call maintenance caused by new artwork.  This tended to
have a non-trivial amount of time spent fixing bugs.  There are a lot of
shortcuts taken in the renderer to optimize for speed.  This means that
there can be several different code paths that could be taken depending
on small changes in the data.  Some of these code paths may not be
exercised until Parker/Stu try something new.  I'd plan on this taking
some time if new artwork is coming in (maybe half a week per month).
One point worth bringing up here is Wolfie-boy.  When Wolf would find an
art problem, he'd often try to work around it himself before asking me
if I thought it was a bug.  Sometimes this led to very creative
work-arounds being checked-in without me even knowing that a bug
existed.  This was pretty inefficient considering that I was on-site,
and fixing a bug once through programming is much better than fixing it
N times in the artwork.  With me not there anymore, maybe what Wolf did
is the right thing to do now.  See below about on-site source code.
<P>
The last maintenance issue was AC drops.  This took me normally about
one day per drop, but could sometimes take as long as 3 days per drop.
This is because AC doesn't run most of the code that EC runs (for
example, AC never uses picking and that is one of the areas that tends
to get broken the most).  Nowadays AC should be 100% responsible for
their drops working.  This will take a little getting used to for both
AC and EC.  Don't expect the first couple of drops to work.  When you
get a drop, test it thoroughly and get back to AC ASAP with the bugs.
If you end up waiting a week or two, the source will have changed again
and it'll be hard to make any progress.
<P>

<H3>New versions of the renderer</H3>
<I>Should we be diligently getting upgrades from AC?<BR>
How expensive is the integration?</I>
<P>
<B>RussP:</B>

It's really a short-term vs long-term decision.  Staying current is good
for the long term but it means you've got to spend more time dealing
with updates.  My belief is that it's worth staying current.  Mike also
has some opinions of this so you should check with him.
<P>
Also, see above, for comments about AC drops.
<P>

<H3>Source code</H3>
We should be able to get source code from AnyChannel. Here's an e-mail from
Russ, summarizing a conversation between Russ, Brian (from AnyChannel), Ellen, 
and Mike:
<P>
<CODE>
Here's the intent (as best as I remember it) of what EC will need
to put into a legal document for both EC and AC to sign.
<P>
1) AC agrees to let the source code to the AnyWorld renderer be
on site at EC so long as it is at least as secure as EC's own
proprietary source code.  The renderer is solely owned by AC
and is considered AC proprietary and confidential.  Under no
conditions is EC allowed to let anyone outside of EC have
access to the renderer source code, unless specifically
approved by AC.
<P>
2) The sole purpose of letting the source code be on site at EC
is for maintenance.  Both companies recognize that having the
source code at EC allows EC to more quickly isolate bugs which
may or may not be in the renderer.  This allows EC to develop
its own software faster, and frees AC from being needlessly
interrupted to track down bugs that may not be in the renderer.
As per the contract already in force between EC and AC, EC
will be making requests of AC to fix bugs in the renderer.
EC is also free to fix bugs in the renderer so long as any
bug fixes it makes are made available to AC.
<P>
3) During the term of the current contract through Nov 30, 1998,
EC and AC will make all reasonable efforts to maintain a
single source tree.  In the unlikely event that having a
single source tree is unworkable, EC can elect to solely
work off of the last known good source tree, effectively
creating two disparate trees.  EC acknowledges that requesting
bug fixes from AC after such a fork will be more costly
than if the two companies were on a single shared source tree.
This is due in part to the need of any AC engineers to be
on-site at EC to make fixes, as well as the additional
ramp up time for an engineer to work off an older source tree.
<P>
4) After the term of the current contract expires on Nov 30, 1998,
the renderer source code for EC will be "frozen".  Any new
maintenance or feature work will be negotiated at that time.
</CODE>

<H3>Java3D</H3>
Sounds good. Brand new, so it's likely to be buggy. Its performance is untested, 
but probably slow, since it sits on top of openGL, which is notoriously slow in 
software. This might be a very interesting migration path, though, in a year or 
so, when 3D boards become more and more prevalent. See the secion below on 3D
Accelerator support for known problems with migrating to a 3D-accelerated solution.

<H3>3D Accelerator support</H3>
<I>How bad is it from a marketing standpoint that we don't have 3D accelerator support 
with our current renderer?</I>
<P>
<B>RussP:</B>
<P>
The renderer currently has 3D accelerator support in it for 3Dfx, ATI
and I think PowerVR.  The problem comes with wanting to run in a window.
Some of these cards flat out don't support running in a window (I think
it will be 2-3 years before the installed base of 3D cards that support
windowing outnumber the installed base of 3D cards that don't).  Even
ignoring that, 3D cards have hard memory constraints.  Running in
full-screen mode, regions would need to be designed with these
constraints in mind.  But wait, it gets worse!  If your user is running
their desktop at 1280x1024x16bit, they're chewing up 2MB of video RAM.
You'll need to allocate a front-buffer, back-buffer, and z-buffer for
uCosm, and then whatever scraps of memory are left can be used for
textures.  It really sucks that the application can know ahead of time
how much memory will actually be available (in fact, the user can even
change resolutions while the app is running).  Probably the best thing
to come along to help this pathetic situation is AGP.  AGP allows system
RAM to be used for textures (however, this RAM is like a disk buffer,
it's a fixed size that is allocated at boot time and cannot be used for
anything other than graphics).  This means that the front/back/z-buffers
can live on the card, what's left over on the card can be used for
textures, and then whatever memory has been set aside from the system
RAM can be used for extra textures.  It still won't be painless, but I
think it becomes possible.


<H3>Renderer interface</H3>
<I>How well have we laid out the renderer border? <BR>
How hard/easy would it be to drop in a new renderer?<BR>
Ideally, we'd want to just change wrapper code in one place.</I>
<P>
<B>RussP:</B>
<P>
The border is pretty clean except for the dirty rectangles stuff (which
isn't even present in the API, but it's sort of intrinsic to the way the
API works as a whole).  If the dirty rectangles can go away, then
swapping out the renderer becomes a much easier task (one data point
though: EC gets about a 5-10x speedup using dirty rectangles).

<H3>Snapshotting/Dirty rectangles)</H3>
<B>RussP:</B>
<P>
Here's some dirty rectangle background:  Rendering is accomplished
through a display list (so you don't have to send down everything you
want drawn every frame).  This is something that could easily be
emulated at the Scene level if the new renderer was a purely immediate
mode API.  However, the display list buys EC a lot because of the dirty
rectangles code.  This can also be emulated at the Scene level, although
it will be much more work.  The Scene would need to know all about the
matrices and device coordinate locations of all the geometry.
Maintaining this in the renderer is a natural fit.  Maintaining this
above the renderer means that geometry is getting transformed both above
and beloew the API (or there have to be queries back and forth) and
backgrounds need to be restored based on dirty areas.

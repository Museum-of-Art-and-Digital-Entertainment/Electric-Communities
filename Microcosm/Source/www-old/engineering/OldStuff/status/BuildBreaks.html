<h2>The Archived Build Mailing List</h2>

<A
HREF="/archives/ec_build/">ec_build:</A>
is an archived list of recent build news. In particular, it contains
all Felix's daily build news messages.

<h2>Current And Very Recent Build Breaks</h2>

<ul>

<li>12/31/97 Checkpoint and revival is unreliable. Revival sometimes
hangs. Need more information on this one. We don't even know how to
reproduce it yet.

<li>12/31/97 If you create something from the catalog, so it appears
in your hand, and then you change regions you won't be able to put
down the object (or put it into your pocket). This one's been in for a
while - Scott spotted it a couple of releases ago.

<li>12/16/97 Release r115 (and all subsequent releases) tend to
deadlock at startup; developers may see this too, especially if using
AccountManager (try run.bat if you do hit this problem). We've integrated
Gordie's deadlock workaround but it doesn't seem to catch all cases.

</ul>

<h2>Recent Build Breaks (All Fixed)</h2>

<ul>

<li>12/29/97 (Fixed by John + Trev 12/29/97 - rolled back a checkin)
Walking "gesture" broken - avatar won't walk.

<li>12/29/97 (Fixed by Sidney 12/29/97 - rolled out some changes to
Openers). Crashes when checkpointing or connecting two HabiFoos, if
using the Beta JIT. These are NT/Windows level crashes (no Java
backtrace, just the application error popup).

<li>12/18/97 (Fixed by Alex and Claire) Busy cursor doesn't disappear
after transition is finished.

<li>12/18/97 (Fixed by Tony, 12/22/97) Watermarks were not
showing up. Turned out to be a mismatch between the realm text
files and the repository.

<li>12/18/97 (Workaround by Dima, 12/22/97) Repository was loading
twice. Turned out to be due to class garbage collection. Temporarily
disabled class garbage collection to avoid the problem.

<li>12/18/97 (Fixed by Felix, 12/19/97) The "make full-release" target
is broken again. Felix is looking into it.

<li>12/18/97 (Fixed by MarkM, 12/19/97) Simultaneous changes to
recipes, Appearance3D and the repository caused some chaos. Kari,
MarkM and Kirk are working on it.

<li>12/18/97 (Fixed by RobJ, 12/19/97) HackDepends was broken by a
checkin on 12/17, resulting in excessive recompilation. RobJ (who
didn't break it) fixed the problem.

<li>12/18/97 (Workaround by Dima, 12/22/97) The initial splash screen no
longer loads properly. May be due to repository changes? (was in
fact due to class garbage collection)

<li>12/18/97 (Fixed by Felix 12/18/97) realm.Games.txt was deleted
without updating makefile.

<li>12/18/97 (Fixed by Harry, 12/19/97) 2D Avatars "moon walk" due to
change in Kirk's code that needs to be allowed for in Harry's
code. Harry is fixing.

<li>12/17/97 (Fixed by Dima, 12/17) Latest build often fails when
trying to connect to PLS or another HabiFoo. It's probably a problem
with regular expressions (they changed last night, and they are used
to parse EARLs, which are used when you try to connect to another
HabiFoo).

<li>12/16/97 New spam at startup; lots of error messages about
widgets being unable to find images.

<li>12/16/97 (Fixed by Mike, 12/16) Todays repository doesn't seem to
have certificates so TOS will be broken. Attempting to build your own
repository doesn't help, seems like the repository build process is
not reaching the certification server. Mike is working to fix this.

<li>12/10/97 The following was fixed by Eric, who got the full-release
target working again (making some of the description below irrelevant)
When building a full release (as described in <A
href="BuildRelease.html">Building a release</a>) two of the later
targets don't work properly. hub-release fails trying to copy First
Part (FP) DLLs into the release area. Felix is looking at this. And
build-zipfiles appears to succeed but produces zipfiles containing the
wrong pathnames. Mike and Felix are looking at this.

<li>12/15/97 Bill found that ".\regupdate -dev -debug" in
"\Build\Release\bin" didn't work properly, after starting up a 4dos
(Build) shell and doing "make nobuild release getrep". Fix was to use
Felix's new "-savepaths" argument e.g. ".\regupdate -debug
-savepaths". "-dev" doesn't seem to work properly (and should be
removed?).

<li>12/15/97 Bill got a weird repository error when he did a "make
nobuild release getrep" in \src. Since then no-one has been able to
reproduce it.

<li>12/15/97 run.bat has preloading turned on by default, resulting in
a class not found error at run time. As of around 11:00am, 12/15, Mike
has checked in a fix, and as of 12:30 Felix checked his fix into \EC.
Check out in \EC to get the fixed run.bat.

<li>12/15/97 When building in \media you may get an error of the form:
"/ec/gnu/bin/find: lib: No such file or directory". You can workaround
it by creating the \media\lib directory manually. As of 12:30pm on
12/15 Felix has checked in a fix, which you can get by doing "cvs
update create.bom" in \media.

<li>12/12/97 A new E runtime fix was checked in with a file missing
(EChannel.java) causing the build to break. The file was checked in on
12/13, fixing the problem.

<li>12/12/97 RtCodeableThrowable was moved to a different package, but
the src\cosm1 tree wasn't updated. Fixed later on 12/12.

<li>12/10/97 All the makefile targets changed, and the docs didn't
until later in the day. Latest docs now have the new targets.

<H2>
RAM</H2>
<B>Problem: Yellow bellied swap sucker.</B> The hub thrashes with more
than seven people in it.

<P><B>The Story So Far: </B>The Java VM was instrumented and found not
to be the problem.&nbsp; Chip and Russ instrumented Win95's own malloc()
to capture most allocations and do a full map of the address space; we
found many mysterious 1 megabyte chunks.&nbsp; Russ hypothesized that these
were thread stacks (though exactly what kind of thread stack is still a
bit unclear).&nbsp; Some tests with -ss100k vs. -ss1m seem to indicate
this is the case.&nbsp; The further theory is that Dan's reuse-a-single-run-queue-thread
fix (it used to make new ones all the time) had a big effect.&nbsp; As
of Friday 12/19, we are able to get 17 people into a hub without the working
set going haywire.

<P>There may be other swap suckers!&nbsp; There are certainly other performance
and stability problems.&nbsp; We will be doing runs intensively all next
week and fixing as much as we can as fast as we can.

<P><B>Current Approaches:</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>RAM swap sucker:</B> Solaris hub version: new build environment on Solaris?</LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> We don't know if the swap sucker is potentially
a Windows-only thing.&nbsp; Be nice to find out... but deprioritized.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Data about whether the swap sucker is Windows-only,
or whether it (or some other sucker) strikes on Solaris too.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Bob, with Eric [Bob says makefile rule problems
are in the way; Eric is helping and hopes to have that done by the end
of Wednesday, 12/10.]
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Working set analysis: </B>We do not know for sure that our working set
is reasonable or stable.&nbsp; We will need to spend a lot of cycles next
week carefully watching the working set of our hub.</LI>

<BR><B>Anticipated outcome: </B>We get a hub that runs with many people
connected in only a few megabytes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>World instantiation overhead:</B> It seems to take a lot more memory
to read in the Preview realm than to read in OneRegion.&nbsp; This doesn't
bode well for our RAM consumption when hosting many regions.&nbsp; We need
to do some intensive load tests with much bigger realms next week as well.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>32 meg machines:</B> We have not done enough testing recently with 32
megabyte machines.&nbsp; We need to track down stress.exe (which can artificially
limit the RAM available to Windows) so we can do some testing early next
week with our current 64M machines.&nbsp; Paul and Alan are looking into
this today (including setting the Java heap size lower so it doesn't try
to grab so much heap).</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<H2>
Startup</H2>
<B>Problem: Class loading.&nbsp; </B>When we start up, we need to load
about 2,100 classes.&nbsp; This is not an unreasonable number for an app
as large as ours (if we were written in C++ this whole issue would not
exist), but most Java VMs are not optimized for loading classes quickly
and take 30 to 60 seconds to load them all.&nbsp; Yet we <I>must</I> find
a way to speed this up, as it currently dominates startup time and 50+-second
startup is not acceptable in the market (no competitive app takes that
long to start up).

<P>Cafe is one Java development environment (from Symantec) which we are
looking at.&nbsp; Supercede (from Asymetrix) is the other.&nbsp; The best
hope for both seems to be to compile all of Microcosm into one native-code
executable file (.exe), which will load orders of magnitude faster than
the piecemeal class-loading and class-parsing of our current VMs.

<P><B>Current Approaches:</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Cafe compiling all our source: </B>Some tweaks to the E runtime and
to the Cafe project have yielded a natively-compiled E runtime which
seems to work properly.&nbsp; Progress is being made on the Cafe front.</LI>

<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> We get Cafe to compile all our code into
an .exe and we get much faster startup.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Jay (and perhaps others soon if Supercede doesn't
pan out)
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Openers porting to Supercede/Cafe</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> The openers library uses one non-standard Sun VM
hook; if we didn't use that hook, we could perhaps get onto other platforms
(VMs and compilation environments) more easily.&nbsp; It turns out that
there are <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/archives/ec_tech/1472.html">equivalent
hooks under the hood</A> in most Java VM's.&nbsp; Sidney is working on
porting openers to Supercede so Wayne and Dima can make more progress.
Update: the port gets as far as Supercede launching to the login screen,
then craps out; Sidney and Dima are working on it.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> We get openers (and hence comm, checkpointing,
and the repository) working under Supercede and Cafe.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Sidney, Dima
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>State bundles</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Arturo has (in ~arturo) a full source tree that
implements state-bundle-based persistence (saving AND loading) of Microcosm.&nbsp;
It still needs some work and is not merged with the current source.&nbsp;
Arturo will be merging it and checking it in on his return; meanwhile,
Scott and Trev are fixing up the save file format and the avatar's serialization/deserialization,
respectively.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> We get substantially faster saving and
somewhat faster loading of saved turfs, as well as the ability to upgrade
our code while keeping our worlds.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Arturo, ScottL, Trev</UL>
<B>Problem: Overall startup</B> <B>time</B>
<BR><B>Current Approaches:</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Lots of startup tweaking</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Outside of class loading, there doesn't seem to
be a big startup/revive hog, so we're looking for lots of ways to shave
seconds off the startup time. For example, changing UI art to 8-bit rather
than 24-bit cuts two seconds off startup. Also, Menus.txt is currently
parsed on every startup of Microcosm.&nbsp; It could be parsed once and
stored in the repository, saving that time.&nbsp; Likewise, realm.txt files
are parsed on every (initial) startup.&nbsp; Mike is also putting in more
timing code to help find the choke points.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Lots of small improvements on startup.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Claire, Mike</UL>

<H2>
Region transitions</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Reducing comm traffic: RobJ's transition optimizing?</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Walendo has instrumentation to provide visibility
on what happens during region transition; RobJ will be using it to optimize
this week (Karl has taken over most of the class bloat work).
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Region transitions get down under 10K,
hopefully down under 5K.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Robj
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>E modem benchmarks</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>We do not currently know how many E round trips
a 28.8K modem can give us.&nbsp; This will put an upper bound on our network
protocols' latency (of course, a lagging server will dramatically worsen
the situation).</UL>

<H2>
Scaling</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Stability with many people:</B>&nbsp; The recent hub runs have not thrashed
the server to death, but they still seem to bog down at about 8 or 9 people
in the world.&nbsp; Some of this seems due to weird comm exceptions that
Rob's presence spread code was not handling very well; some is due to other
as yet undetermined stuff.&nbsp; We need more visibility on how hubs perform
under load (and on how loaded the comm system is), and we have LOTS, LOTS
LOTS LOTS, more work to do to get a really robust scalable hub.</LI>

<BR><B>Anticipated outcome: </B>Double-digit people logged into the hub
without breaking a sweat.&nbsp; (We must have this in order to ship!&nbsp;
and it can't come too soon.)
<BR><B>People involved:</B> Anybody and everybody.</UL>

<H2>
General</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Prolonged run leakage</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Run for a long time and objects accumulate for
no very apparent reason.&nbsp; The more this happens the worse we will
scale.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> We kill them all and we can run indefinitely.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>John, RobJ (soon)</UL>

<H2>
Resolved/Deferred</H2>

<H3>
RAM</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Thread stack consumption:</B> We wound up going with 64k stacks on the
latest hub tests and it seems to run OK!&nbsp; 1M per thread seems like
a lot, and does not scale to a hub with many connections.&nbsp; There are
several things we can do.&nbsp; The simplest:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Reduce the current -ss1m to -ss128k or so and see what behavior we get
(last time it died down in Java GC due to inability to do a deep mark pass
on some way-too-big data structures; the big structures are probably bugs
anyway, and Java 1.1.4 is supposedly better about this).</LI>
</UL>
This was being tried on the hub tests on Tuesday 12/16.&nbsp; News forthcoming.
<BR>Reengineeringwise, we can:
<UL>
<LI>
Make each connection create only one thread instead of two.</LI>

<LI>
Make encode/decode happen in the vat thread, and make the comm threads
use smaller stacks.</LI>
</UL>
ScottL doesn't think these are good ideas, though, as threads in other
Java environments seem nowhere near so expensive (his last Java project
had 150+ threads, no problem), and this would be a lot of engineering work
in some already-complex code.&nbsp; First we will try with the smaller
thread stacks and evaluate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Walendo's Windows API logger</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Alan has a tool that logs every Windows NT API
call. We will be using it for our NT runs as we do more swap sucker analysis.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Alan
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Comm system VM size investigation:</B> what eats 3M per connection?</LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Walendo found that on each connection the process
size grows by a good chunk.&nbsp; This turns out to be mostly the 1m thread
stacks of the two threads that get started per connection.&nbsp; There
are various fixes for this being debated now.
<BR><B>People involved:</B> Walendo and Gordie
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Chip's/Russ's native DLL instrumentation</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Chip and Russ instrumented the Java VM and the
C runtime's malloc(), and augmented analdump, so we can log every call
to malloc() and free() that we can intercept (which is most but not quite
all of them), and get a view on the process's complete address space.&nbsp;
This tool enabled us to find the multiple 1M chunks of the thread-stack
swap sucker.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> We seem to have found the big swap sucker,
but next week's runs will confirm or refute this.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Trev, Alan, Russ, Chip, Alex.</UL>

<H3>
Startup</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Class bloat fixes</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Karl has written the code needed to reduce the
compile-time classes produced by over 50% and has host-client Pluribus
test cases working; he's now&nbsp; merging with Microcosm! It is getting
checked in as I type this.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Substantial compile-time reduction in number
of classes produced (hopefully producing some compilation speedup in cosm1/objects/una
to boot); some run-time reduction in class load time.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Karl, Robj
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Supercede native library link problem</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Supercede was choking on native libraries.&nbsp;
Much good help from Asymetrix has given us the fixes we need, and they
do indeed support JNI.&nbsp; Full speed ahead.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> We get Supercede to make us a peachy fast-loading
.exe.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Dima, Wayne, Bill
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Scott's optimized loader</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>ScottL tried out an optimized classloader for loading
all our classes upfront quickly.&nbsp; It looks like this may speed up
startup by only 7 seconds, and that only if loading only the classes we
need gets our pre-login window load time down to about 12 seconds.
<BR><B>Outcome:</B> Mike has checked this in; together with other startup
tweaks our startup time is down to 45 seconds.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>ScottL, Mike
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Supercede subsetting-.exe problem</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Some initial results seem to indicate that Supercede
requires all classes referenced from a native-code-compiled .exe be in
the .exe itself.&nbsp; i.e. it is not clear that implicit (by-reference)
classloading, nor even explicit Class.forName() loading, work from a native-code-compiled
.exe.&nbsp; Bill is helping Wayne make sure. Asymetrix seems to think it
<I>should</I> work. It turns out that the Supercede .exe doesn't read the
CLASSPATH property from the environment; instead it needs to be in a special
.properties file.&nbsp; When Wayne put his CLASSPATH there, Class.forName()
started working from his .exe!
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> We get Supercede to make us a peachy fast-loading
.exe.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Dima, Wayne, Bill
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Postpone sound initialization?</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> It looked for a while like sound was taking too
long to start up, but it turns out it's not (&lt;1 second).
<BR><B>People involved: </B>RobL, Claire
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Process viewer</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Walendo found a tool which displays a process's
heap, but it gets illegal memory access violation loading openers.dll;
he is trying it with alternate startup interface (invoke instead of exec).&nbsp;
This is on the back burner at the moment since it appears that other tools
give us more information.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Odds are it will not give us enough detail
about when exactly the big allocations are happening, but it might quickly
tell us which .dll is responsible
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Walendo, with Markm?</UL>

<H3>
Transitions</H3>
<B>Problem: RAM usage during transitions</B>
<BR><B>Current Approaches:</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>E runtime allocation</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Dan has eliminated all of the objects allocated
in doing E message dispatch.&nbsp; He had some good benchmarks but is redoing
them to increase his confidence in their truth.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Generally better performance under heavy
load; less time spent in ObjAlloc() in the Java VM (the latter can be profiled
to confirm).
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Dan
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Optimizing appearance file loading</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Walendo's timings indicate that we spend significant
time parsing Appearance files every time we read them from the repository
(or otherwise unserializing them).&nbsp; Harry has checked in two recipes
already to speed this up.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Another few seconds shaved off of every
region transition!
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Harry, Sidney, MarkM
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Problem:</B> Still 1 meg per transition</LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Fixed!&nbsp; RussP used vadump to find a DirectDraw
leak.&nbsp; Now we leak only 17K per transition which we can live with
for the moment!
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Bounded memory usage over multiple transitions
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Russ/Paul/Claire
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Problem:</B> Seven round trips per initial teleport!!!</LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> Rob looked into the spam of region transitions
and determined there were SEVEN round trips required before the una got
sent over.&nbsp; He eliminated four of them and hopes to check in today
(Monday 12/22).
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Better region transition times especially
over modems!
<BR><B>People involved:</B> Rob, Trev, Walendo</UL>

<H3>
Scaling</H3>

<H3>
General</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>What about 21 threads? All sensible?</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> We have 21 threads.&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/archives/ec_perf/0352.html">Here's
the scoop.</A>&nbsp; Some of the timer threads may be killable.&nbsp; Tasks
perhaps pending...&nbsp; We do not currently know if we are spending much
time in lock contention.&nbsp; See the RAM notes for more about the evils
of threads.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome:</B> Less thread overhead
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Bill
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Checkpoint disrepancy</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation: </B>Checkpointing on Sidney's machine takes around
10 seconds, yet when Alison benchmarks it, it takes on the order of 5 minutes
or so without the tracing turned on. It turns out this is because of the
beta JIT; when Alison uses the beta JIT with the checkpoint warnings turned
off, she can reproduce Sidney's faster timings.
<BR><B>Anticipated outcome: </B>As predicted by Sidney, this seems to be
due to the build environment still using the slow Javasoft 1.1.3 non-JIT
VM.
<BR><B>People involved: </B>Sidney, Alison
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Tools for working set visiblity &amp; tuning</B></LI>

<BR><B>Explanation:</B> We needed tools to display our working set during
a run.&nbsp; Walendo's tool vadump (look for description in the tools pages
XXX TREV LINK HERE) seems to do the trick.</UL>

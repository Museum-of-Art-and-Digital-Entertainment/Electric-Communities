<P>In order to get two Habi*'s talking to eachother, one of them needs
to know the address of the other one so it can make contact. In the e (language)
world, those addresses are known as SturdyRefs and the human readable version
of them is called an EARL ("e absolute reference locator", I seem to remember)

<P>This means that if you're running a client and you want to enter a region
hosted by some server somewhere, you need to supply the SturdyRef of the
destination region to your client.  You could just type in the EARL
(the readable form of the SturdyRef) by hand, but since they're a bit more
complex than a typical URL that's fairly inconvenient. For example, an
EARL might look like this:
<PRE>  e://george.communities.com:1669;gracie.communities.com:1669;
  harpo.communities.com:1669/4rolqnhtrjjtb1fp0fimwr7xub5hyhm/ivxwc8</PRE>
.mcm files came about as a way to package these kinds of addresses in a
way that people could deal with. This way, when you run a Habi*, you can
just hand it a .mcm file containing the address of the region you want
to enter  (it's actually the address of the destination teleport pad)
and off you'll go. This is what you're doing when you use run.bat and give
it the "rgnFile = ./PublishedRefs/foo.mcm" argument, and this is also what
happens under the covers when you double click on a .mcm file in a mail
message, on a web page, or in your explorer window. The latter case is
handled by <A HREF="HabiSplat.html">HabiSplat</A>, and is explained on
<A HREF="HabiSplat.html">this</A> page.  BTW, if you haven't guessed,
the extension .mcm was chosen when the products name was Microcosm.

<P>Originally, .mcm files contained only the EARL of a  teleport pad
- but as time went on we discovered the need for passing around the SturdyRefs
of avatars along with address book information as well. (This way, I could
email you my in-world "contact information" as a .mcm filed and when you
double clicked on it,  Habi* would enter the information into your
avatar's address book. And, since you'd have my the SturdyRef of my avatar,
you could open a direct telepathy connection without even being on the
same hub as me. You could also make sure you have the latest contact info
for me by contacting me directly and asking for an update.).

<P>Thus, .mcm files now contain exported java.util.Properties objects.
A typical teleport pad .mcm file might look like this:

When you start Habi*, it creates one .mcm file for your avatar (the 'contact
information file) called Name_ID.mcm and one .mcm file for each of the
teleport pads in the realm that you're hosting. By default, these files
live in the PublishedRefs subdirectory of your Habi* install directory.
The teleportpad .mcm files live in a subdirectory of PublishedRefs named
after your avatar. So, if you start TwoRegions up and log in as Dax, you'll
end up with the following files:
<PRE>    PublishedRefs\Dax_ID.mcm                  (the contact info)
    PublishedRefs\Dax\Park-Entrance.mcm       (teleport pad)
    PublishedRefs\Dax\Aztec-Turf.mcm          (teleport pad)</PRE>
Internally, Habi* looks for the 'Type' field first and decides what to
do based on its value. At the moment, it only understands "Type=AvatarID"
and "Type=TeleportPad". The code inside of Habi* that deals with .mcm files
is mostly in AvatarReceptionist_ingr.plu if you're curious. The code EXTERNAL
to Habi* that deals with .mcm files lives in HabiSplat.cpp. See the page
on <A HREF="HabiSplat.html">HabiSplat</A> for info on how that works. 
If you've got any questions on .mcm files, ask <A HREF="mailto:walendo@communities.com">walendo</A>.

<BR><U>.mcmav Files</U>

<P>.mcmav files are similar to .mcm files, except that they are only used
as a mechanism to store information about the avatar accounts that you've
got setup. For instance, if you've created two avatars named Foo and Bar,
you'll get two .mcmav files named Foo.mcmav and Bar.mcmav in the
<BR>Avatars subdirectory of your Habi* install directory. These files might
look like this:
<PRE>  #Wed Feb 04 15:01:06 PST 1998
  Encrypted=no
  AvatarBody=animations/Dax.appearance2d
  DefaultStartRegion=NewParkScroll1
  ProcessDirectory=Processes\\Process_0
  AvatarName=Foo
  checkpoint=Processes\\Process_0\\checkpoint.evat</PRE>
The information contained in there isn't useful to any Habi* installation
other than your own and these files aren't meant to be given out to anyone.
The login and account manager use them to keep track of the accounts available
when you start Habi*. <A HREF="mailto:dima@communities.com">Dima</A> is
the creator and maintainer of these files, so he can answer any questions
you might have about them. I'll take a shot at the field definitions, though.

<P> Encrypted: whether or not the checkpoint file is encrypted (needs
a passwd)
<BR> AvatarBody: which body your avatar has
<BR> DefaultStartRegion: self explanatory
<BR> ProcessDirectory: where to find the checkpoint files for this
avatar
<BR> AvatarName: self explanatory
<BR> checkpoint: the name of the checkpoint file for this avatar

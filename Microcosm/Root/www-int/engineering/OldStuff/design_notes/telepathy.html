<h2>Introduction</h2>

In the Microcosm UI telepathy balloons are the ones specifically
addressed to another avatar. Though telepathy and normal
<A href="conversation.html">conversation</a> look very similar
in the UI, they are implemented by different mechanisms.
<p>
Telepathy is handled by the telepathy manager ingredient in the
avatar unum. Telepathy communication is peer to peer, it does not go
through the region. The telepathy manager in one avatar communicates
via a facet with the telepathy manager ingredient in another avatar.
The facet is set up via the <A href="identity.html">identity</a>
capability exchange mechanism.
<p>
Because telepathy goes directly between the two avatars (well
it goes via a facet, but the facet is co-hosted with one of the
avatars) it is more secure than normal conversation, which
goes via the region. The comm system and identity mechanism
ensure that if you can reliably know who telepathy is from, and
be sure that its contents has not been tampered with.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Architecture Overview</h4>

The telepathy manager ingredient registers itself as a capability
request handler with the avatars identity object. This means that if a
request for a telepathy capability comes in to the identity, it will
call on the telepathy manager ingredient to create the capability.
<p>
So suppose avatar A wants to send telepathy to avatar B. Avatar A
makes an identity capability request, with the
<code>requestName</code> parameter set to the appropriate value for
telepathy. The identity code calls into B's telepathy manager, asking
if it will grant a telepathy capability to A. B's telepathy manager
checks with the address book to see if A is allowed to send
telepathy. If so B creates a new "identi facet", stamped with A's
identity, and gives this facet back to A, via the identity
mechanism. If A is not allowed telepathy, B ethrows an error.
<p>
If the request succeeded, A now has a telepathy capability for talking
to B. This capability is an "identi facet"; A can call on it to send
telepathy to B, but when the facet relays the telepathy to B it will
add in A's identity as an argument, so B knows can be sure sent it.
The facet is hosted on B's machine; A just gets a proxy to it. This
means that the internals of the facet object, which store A's
identity, can't be changed by A.
<p>
B does not keep a reference to the telepathy capability. It is kept in
existence by A's (proxy) reference to it. This is nice because B
doesn't have to worry about cleaning up the capability; when A no
longer needs it, it will be garbage collected. In the current code A
uses the capability once and throws it away. This is bad, and slows
down repeated telepathy. The telepathy manager should cache recently
used telepathy capabilities.

<h4>Name Resolution</h4>

Another job of the telepathy manager ingredient is to provide the UI
with a list of known avatar names, so the UI can autocomplete names
for the user. The telepathy manager uses the address book to do all
the hard work. It calls into the address book, asking for a list of
all known avatar names. The address book maintains an
IdentityNameTable (see <A href="identity_name.html">Identity
Naming</a>) and it calls in to that table to get a sorted list of all
avatar names that are in use or on the recent list.
<p>
When a name has been typed in to the UI, the UI calls back into
the telepathy manager to resolve the name to an identity. Again the
telepathy manager calls into the address book, which uses its
IdentityNameTable to resolve the name.

<h4>Telepathy Flow</h4>

When A sends telepathy to B the full sequence is as follows
(this assumes A hasn't cached a telepathy capability to B,
which is always the case - unfortunately - with the current code):

<ol>
<li>A's telepathy manager receives the telepathy and a target identity
from the UI
<li>A's telepathy manager, via A's identity object, sends a request
for a telepathy capability to B's identity object.
<li>B's identity object relays the request to B's telepathy manager,
which has registered to handle telepathy requests.
<li>B's telepathy manager checks in the address book to see if A
is allowed telepathy (we'll assume this check succeeds)
<li>B's telepathy manager creates a new telepathy capability -
an "identi facet", stamped with A's identity.
<li>B gives the facet to A, via the identity and capability
receipt mechanism
<li>A sends telepathy to the facet. The facet is a proxy so the
telepathy will go across the wire (unless A is sending telepathy
to itself!).
<li>The telepathy arrives at the facet, which then calls into B's
telepathy manager ingredient, giving as arguments A's identity and
the telepathy.
<li>B's telepathy manager checks if A is allowed to send telepathy
to B (this could have changed since the facet was issued). If so
it hands the identity and telepathy text to the UI, for display.
<li>A's telepathy manager does an <code>ewhen</code> on the telepathy
facet; when the body of the <code>ewhen</code> fires A assumes the
telepathy has arrived successfully and it displays the telepathy
locally so the user knows it arrived (maybe an explicit callback
would be better here?)
</ol>


<h4>Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Telepathy is intended to be secure and should work even if both
avatars are in their turfs (i.e. are not connected to any common
hub). As a consequence telepathy may create a new, secure, comm
connection between the machines hosting the avatars.
<li>The telepathy ingredient all runs in the E thread, with the
exception of some methods which are called by the UI. The UI
holds the vat lock while calling these methods, so the telepathy
ingredient can assume that it is only accessed by one thread at
a time.
</ul>


<h2>Detailed Design</h2>

The telepathy manager ingredient is Pluribus code, so it's not
JavaDoc'd. The interfaces are pretty simple though. Here's
the code for the telepathy capability (identi facet):

<pre>
  /**
   * Telepathy capability; this is an "identifacet" which marks all telepathy
   * requests with the identity of the sender.
   */
  eclass eTelepathyCapability {

    /** Senders identity */
    private SturdyIdentity mySender;

    /** Target telepathy receiver */
    eiTelepathyReceiver myReceiver;

    /** Constructor */
    eTelepathyCapability(SturdyIdentity sender, eiTelepathyReceiver receiver) {
      mySender = sender;
      myReceiver = receiver;
    }

    /** Method used by sender to send telepathy to receiver */
    emethod sendTelepathy(Speech speech) throws IdentityException {
      myReceiver <- receiveTelepathy(mySender, speech);
    }

    /** Value method returns this, for ewhen convenience */
    local Object value() {
      return this;
    }

  }
</pre>

The telepathy manager ingredient implements the eiTelepathyReceiver
interface, so the facet's <code>myReceiver</code> variable will point
at the telepathy manager ingredient.
<p>
The <code>sendTelepathy</code> method is really the only new
inter-machine protocol introduced by telepathy; everything else is
handled by the identity protocol.

<h4>Error Handling</h4>

The telepathy code has to check for network and permission denied
errors at many points (note that the <code>sendTelepathy</code> method
may throw <code>IdentityException</code>). It also times out if it
gets no response from the other avatar. The timeout code needs
work. The system is often slow enough that the timeout happens,
causing an error message, and then the telepathy gets through
anyway. This is confusing for users.


<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<ul>
<li>Turn on the "telepathy" trace category to get telepathy tracing.
</ul>


<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Telepathy was originally implemented via a telepathy conversation
unum, which reused the Conversation ingredient. This implementation
was more complex, less secure and left lots of garbage around. The
current facet approach is much simpler, but doesn't reuse any
conversation code.
</ul>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>The telepathy manager should keep a cache of recently used
telepathy capabilities. The cache shouldn't be too large (because each
capability would keep a connection open). And you'd have to watch out
for stale cache entries (if you get a network error using an old
capability it doesn't mean that the avatar isn't reachable - it may
have restarted its session).
<li>The telepathy manager could hand out persistent telepathy
capabilities - SturdyRefs not just proxies. This would introduce more
garbage collection problems though - when would you clean them up?
What if someone decided to use one right when you decided to clean it
up?
<li>Telepathy should give better feedback to the user as a request
progresses. And it should not seem to fail (due to a timeout) and
then subsequently succeed!
<li>The notification that telepathy has been displayed successfully
at the recipients end should be done via an explicit "done"
notification, rather than an <code>ewhen</code>.
</ul>

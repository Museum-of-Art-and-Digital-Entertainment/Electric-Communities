</B>
<P>The code that corresponds to steps 1…3 for PeekerPoker is shown next. Note the
resemblance with the code for PeekablePokeable. The important difference lies in the
behavior. The purpose of a Peeker is to Peek at a Peekable, and in order to do so
Peeker should be able to refer to Peekable, thus the need to add a parameter of kind
<FONT FACE="Courier">ukPeekable</FONT> within its parameter list.  The second
parameter is a string containing the actual message sent between Peekable and
Peeker.</P>
<P>Note that for PeekerPoker there is no client code since PeekerPoker is utilized only to have some effect over Peekable and Pokable. That is, even if a client for PeekerPoker is created it would not be used at all. Beware that this might not be so in other applications and in such cases a client would have to be coded.</P>

<P>This finalizes the basic elements needed for the PeekPoke unum. The next step is to
define the actual behavior of the unum in the ingredient implementation.</P>

<P>Internet Foundation Classes (IFC) is a user interface class library 
written entirely in Java by Netscape. It is built on top of the AWT 
(Advanced/Abstract/Awkward Windowing Toolkit) library that's part of Sun's 
Java distribution. The IFC designers intended you to be able to do all of
your user interface stuff without directly accessing AWT classes. They did
a pretty good job at this, and you can do a lot of work in IFC without
really understanding Peers and other AWT concepts that aren't in IFC. 
It's usually possible, though frequently awkward, to get at the rare bits
of AWT functionality that you might need using some calls in IFC's 
AWTCompatibility class.</P>

<P>IFC consists of three main packages: 
<ul>
<li><code>netscape.application</code><br>
This contains all the UI components and supporting interfaces, and the
Application class which gets the whole shebang going.</li><P> 
<li><code>netscape.util</code><br>
This contains mostly classes needed to support IFC's archiving mechanism,
which we don't use. It includes IFC's Hashtable and Vector classes, variants
of the like-named classes in java.util that support archiving (which, as I
said, we don't use).</li><P>
<li><code>netscape.constructor</code><br>
This contains classes used in IFC's graphical application builder, which
we don't use. It might be decent, but we had written a lot of IFC code
before it existed and it never seemed worthwhile to go back and redo it
using constructor.</li>
</ul>

<P>We're currently using IFC 1.1.1. There's a 1.1.2 which has a few trivial
changes, but we haven't ever bothered to get it. 1.1.2 is extremely likely
to be the last version of IFC ever.</P>

<P>The IFC distribution includes all the source code as well as javadoc 
documentation for every class. There's also a "developer's guide", which is 
more of a tutorial. There are a couple of books out about IFC, but I don't
know if they're any good. There's a full copy of the IFC distribution in 
Alexandria//home/eng. The people at EC who've used IFC the most are
probably me (<A HREF="mailto:sullivan@communities.com">John</A>),
<A HREF="mailto:amckale@communities.com">Alex</A>, and
<A HREF="mailto:dima@communities.com">Dima</A>.</P>

<A name="JFCandIFC">
<H2>JFC and IFC</H2>
</A>

<P>Somewhere along the line, Netscape and Sun decided to merge their
Java user-interface-toolkit development paths. The result is JFC/Swing.
Swing is a user-interface components class library. JFC (Java Foundation
Classes) is the name for Swing + some 2D graphics libraries + some other
stuff. Swing is more or less the same kind of thing as IFC -- they both have
rich collections of "lightweight" (== "Peerless", in AWT terminology) 
UI components. IFC might have more application-level stuff; Swing is 
definitely bigger and has a richer assortment of components. Probably the
most important difference is that all development on IFC has stopped
forever, whereas Swing (and the rest of the JFC) will be part of Sun's 
Java 1.2 release, and so presumably will be supported and improved over
time. (Swing, but not the rest of JFC, is actually available in the form
of a Java 1.1.x package so you don't have to wait until Java 1.2 is out
before using it.) So if you're starting a project now, it would be foolish to 
choose IFC over Swing. However, Microcosm was started before Swing was a 
twinkle in Sun and Netscape's collective eye.</P>

<A name="MicrocosmAndIFC">
<H2>Microcosm and IFC</H2>
</A>

<P>Microcosm's UI is built on IFC. All the windows in Microcosm, even
the main window, are subclassed from 
<code>netscape.application.ExternalWindow</code>. 
We use IFC user interface classes for buttons, 
scroll bars, check boxes, etc in all windows *except* the main Microcosm 
window. The main Microcosm window uses a rendering engine we're licensing 
from a little company called AnyChannel. The rendering engine (usually 
referred to as "the renderer") needs to control all the bits in its window, 
so we can't put IFC stuff inside windows that use the renderer. This means 
that we have to implement all the appearance and behavior of stuff in the 
main window from scratch, including the buttons at the top and bottom. Of
the people at EC now, <A HREF="mailto:mike@communities.com">Mike</A> and
<A HREF="mailto:claire@communities.com">Claire</A> know the most about the
renderer. (Former contractor <A HREF="mailto:russp@communities.com">Russ</A> 
is/was the expert; he may or may not still be helping us from time to time 
when you read this.) Claire is also the expert on UI interactions in the 
main window</P>

<P>Microcosm's source contains two packages that are primarily subclasses of
IFC classes: <code>ec.ifc.app</code> and <code>ec.ifc.stonelook</code>.

<ul>
<li><code>ec.ifc.app</code><br>
This package is intended to contain IFC subclasses and helper interfaces that
provide new or modified behavior from what's delivered in IFC. In some cases
this means working around bugs in IFC, though mostly it's adding new 
features.</li><P> 

<li><code>ec.ifc.stonelook</code><br>
This package is intended to contain IFC (and <code>ec.ifc.app</code>) 
subclasses that change the appearance but not behavior from what's delivered
in IFC. We've very deliberately kept the behavior and appearance changes
separate, though lately we've been rethinking that decision (see 
<a href="#minimizingIFC">below</a>). It's called "stonelook" for historical 
reasons only; early Microcosm UI design looked like sandstone and marble, 
though the current UI design bears no trace of that earlier look.</li>
</ul>

<A name="IFCvsThreads">
<H2>IFC vs threads</H2>
</A>

<P>Despite the general multi-threadedness of Java, IFC was designed such that 
drawing and component layout code (and maybe more?) must pass through IFC's 
event loop. This means that you should treat IFC for all intents and
purposes as single-threaded. If you call arbitrary IFC methods from a thread
other than the thread containing the IFC event loop, bad things are likely
to happen, usually involving the contents of IFC windows being drawn terribly 
wrong. You may or may not get an exception whose backtrace will conspicuously 
lack evidence of the IFC event loop.</P>

<P>Since Microcosm is multi-threaded and IFC is single-threaded, we need a
technique to funnel IFC requests originating on arbitrary threads into the
one IFC thread. The technique we've developed is as follows:</P>

<ol>
<li><P>For every public class that deals directly with IFC objects, decide 
which methods might be called from another thread. In Microcosm the typical 
case is a class in <code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter</code> that implements an 
interface defined in <code>ec.cosm.ui.presenter</code>. This interface defines 
the methods that might be called from another thread.</P></li>
<li><P>In each of the methods thus defined, delay the guts of the routine
such that they are processed in the IFC event loop. There are two ways to do 
this. The simpler, which is sufficient if at most one parameter is required 
for each of these methods, is to call 
<code>netscape.application.Application.application().performCommandLater()</code>.
This lets you pass a command string, optional parameter object, and an object
that will process the command after it has made a trip through IFC's event loop.
Typically this processor object is the same presenter object that's delaying
the command. Classes that currently use this technique include
<code>ec.cosm.gui.windows.ProgressDialog</code> and 
<code>ec.cosm.gui.windows.PreferencesWindow</code>.</P>

<P>If more than one parameter is required for at least one of these methods, 
you should use the Event technique, which is both more complicated and more
common. With this technique, you create an Event subclass that carries
along any number of parameters as instance variables, then put the newly
created event into IFC's event loop directly by calling
<code>netscape.application.Application.application().eventLoop().addEvent()</code>. 
Classes that currently use this technique include
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIStandardPresenter</code>, 
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUITeleportListPresenter</code>, and
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIAlertPresenter</code>.</P>
</li>
</ol>

<P>It's not the case that every IFC method call from another thread will screw 
things up, but this just makes the bad cases harder to debug. The safest 
approach is to write your code as if the only IFC calls that are legal from
another thread are the ones mentioned above -- the ones that you use to funnel 
messages from other threads into the IFC event loop.</P>

<P>If you find a bug that you suspect may be caused by IFC code being called 
directly from the wrong thread, see if you can narrow it down to a single 
IFC-using method that might have been called from the wrong thread. Then add 
to this method a line of code that prints the stack trace whenever it is 
called. One way to do this is:</P>

<pre>
    System.out.println(ec.trace.Trace.getStackTrace());
</pre>

<P>Then run the software, and check to see if this stack trace always includes 
IFC's event loop. Lines similar to the following, near the top of the stack, 
are evidence  that the code is being called from the IFC thread:</P>

<pre>
    at netscape.application.EventLoop.processEvent(EventLoop.java:142)
    at netscape.application.EventLoop.run(EventLoop.java:175)
    at netscape.application.Application.run(Application.java:249)
</pre>

<P>If these lines aren't present, the code is being called from the wrong 
thread, and you need to deploy one of the techniques described above to force 
the IFC code into being called on the IFC thread.</P>

<A name="IFCvsWindows">
<H2>IFC vs windows</H2>
</A>

<P>Probably IFC's weakest area is window management. Partly this is due to
Java's platform-independent lowest-common-denominator approach. Regardless of
the reasons, it's impossible to get certain window-related operations to
behave as you'd like, and others require trickery. This section will cover
some of these issues.</P>

<P>Note that IFC supports two types of "windows", both implementing interface
<code>netscape.application.Window</code>:
<ul>
<P><li><code>netscape.application.ExternalWindow</code><BR>
This is a normal native Windows window.</li></P>

<P><li><code>netscape.application.InternalWindow</code><BR>
This is a hideous window-like thing that lives 
entirely trapped inside an external window. It's entirely drawn and otherwise 
managed by pure Java code, so it doesn't necessarily look much like a native 
window. </li></P>
</ul>

<P>We have entirely avoided internal windows, and the rest of this
discussion is all about external windows.</P>

<H4>Sizing windows</H4>

<P>An IFC window can have an associated WindowOwner, which receives messages
when certain window-related events occur. One of these messages is
<code>Window.willSizeBy(Window window, Size size)</code>. According to
the IFC documentation, this is called before the window is actually
resized, and by altering the Size object an implementor can prevent or
limit the size change. In practice, this does not work for external windows.
When the user manually resizes a window, this method is called, but not at
the right level for changes to the size to have any effect. Therefore, there
is no way to prevent the window from being resized to whatever arbitrary
size the user chooses. Bummer.</P>

<P>However, often it's really important for the user interface to
enforce a minimum size on a window. Since we can't prevent the user from
resizing the window too small, the best we can do is react to it, and
sproing the window back up to the minimum size as soon as possible after
the user has finished resizing it. This is pretty ugly, both visually and
programatically, but it's better than leaving the window at some broken
tiny size. The approach is to notice in <code>Window.willSizeBy()</code>
that the window is becoming too small, and then post an event to deal
with it later (trying to deal with it immediately gets your code into a
fight with native Windows code, which your code inevitably loses). Classes
that currently use this technique include 
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIStandardPresenter</code> and
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUITeleportListPresenter</code>. 
Read the source for further details.</P>

<H4>Minimizing and maximizing windows</H4>

<P>AWT and IFC alike have no concept of minimizing/maximizing windows,
presumably because this is not a platform-independent feature of windowing
systems. But since an external window is really (or, technically, "has")
a native window, the title bar will include all the little widgies normally
found on a Windows title bar, including the minimize and maximize buttons.
Furthermore, these work, and there's no Java way (as far as I know) to prevent
them from working. Even windows that have been marked not resizable are still
perfectly willing to zoom up to fill the whole screen.</P>

<P>Since this minimizing and maximizing goes on behind Java's back, the
IFC window doesn't even get notified properly when it happens. This led to
various weirdnesses involving maximized windows saving their giant bounds
and minimized windows refusing to open programatically. We worked around
these weirdnesses as best we could in 
<code>ec.ifc.app.ECExternalWindow</code>. That class is heavily commented,
so read the source for the gory details.</P>

<a name="layoutManagers">
<H2>Using IFC LayoutManagers</H2>
</a>

<P>IFC borrows from AWT the concept of LayoutManagers, but the implementation
is independent. We use IFC LayoutManagers extensively in Microcosm.</P>

<P>Probably the most important aspect of IFC LayoutManagers to be aware of is 
that the "no layout manager" case doesn't really work. According to the 
documentation, if a
<code>netscape.application.View</code> has no layout manager, then it uses
its <code>vertResizeInstruction</code> and <code>horizResizeInstruction</code>
to determine how to reposition itself when its container changes size. This
would be a good and useful scheme, but for one pretty much fatal flaw: it
gets unrecoverably messed up at small sizes. The design flaw, which the IFC
folks have acknowledged but didn't seem to worry about, is that the bounds
of each View must be a rectangle with positive width and height. If the
size of the container gets small enough that following the resize instructions
would result in a View with a negative width or height, that View's bounds
get messed up forever -- resizing the container larger later on does not
fix the problem. This flaw combines in a very nasty way with the inability
to prevent windows from being resized to any arbitrary size, as
<A HREF="#IFCvsWindows">discussed earlier</A>. So unless you've got an
extremely simple arrangement of Views, using the resize instructions and
no layout manager is likely to mess up the layout when the window is resized
very small and then large again.</P>

<P>This means you'll need an object that implements interface
<code>netscape.application.LayoutManager</code> to position all the Views
in each window. The approach we've usually taken is to have the Presenter
object with which most every window is associated also act as the
LayoutManager for the window's contents. For StoneLook windows, the object
in which all other Views are placed is 
<code>SLWindow.getContainerView()</code>, so this is the object for which the
Presenter sets itself up as layoutManager. Generally the Presenter object also 
creates the window and creates all the Views inside it. At creation time it 
doesn't need to worry about positioning the Views. Once all the Views have 
been created, it calls <code>containerView.layoutView(0, 0)</code> to
position them. This method is also called by IFC whenever the window is
resized, by the user or programatically. The Presenter's implementation of 
<code>layoutView()</code>
positions every View from scratch, ignoring the delta parameters. This
avoids any of the weird container-so-small-that-contents-got-messed-up
problems. Classes that currently use this technique include
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIStandardPresenter</code>,
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUITeleportListPresenter</code>,
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIPropertySheetPresenter</code>,
and several others. Read the source for further details.</P>

<a name="GUIPresenters">
<H2>GUIStandardPresenter and relatives</H2>
</a>

<P>Much of Microcosm's IFC code is in the form of so-called "GUI Presenters".
These are classes that present information to the user in a graphical
environment (as opposed to "Console Presenters" which present information to
the user in a text-only environment). Another document is due on this whole
Presenter mechanism, but it hadn't been written when I wrote this.</P>

<P>A typical GUI Presenter consists of a class named 
"GUI[something]Presenter", which implements the [something]Presenter interface
defined in package <code>ec.cosm.ui.presenter</code>. This typical GUI
Presenter generally manages a single window or window type and all of its
contents, though sometimes it also manages one or more auxiliary windows.
Examples include 
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIPropertySheetPresenter</code>, which manages 
property sheet windows;
<code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIAddressBookPresenter</code>, which manages
the address book window and auxiliary windows such as the "default privileges"
window; <code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUICatalogPresenter</code>, which
manages catalog windows; and many more. All of these GUI Presenters are in
package <code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter</code>.</P>

<P>To encapsulate much of the behavior and appearance common to many GUI
Presenters, class <code>ec.cosm.gui.uipresenter.GUIStandardPresenter</code> 
was created. This abstract class includes support for vertical tabs along
the left side of the window, a search field and status area at the bottom
of the window, and some other common elements.</P>

<P>Given this, you might expect that all the GUI Presenters subclass from
<code>GUIStandardPresenter</code>, but this is not the case. Some of the
GUI Presenters were written before <code>GUIStandardPresenter</code> came 
along, and it didn't seem worthwhile to rewrite them as subclasses (though in 
the grand scheme of things maybe it would be). 
<code>GUITeleportListPresenter</code> is one such relic. In other cases,
very few of the common elements abstracted in <code>GUIStandardPresenter</code>
were required in a particular presenter, so the implementer chose to do it from
scratch instead. <code>GUIPropertySheetPresenter</code> fits into this
category.</P>

<P>When creating a new GUI Presenter, it's best to subclass from
<code>GUIStandardPresenter</code> if your new GUI Presenter is going to use
vertical tabs, a search field, or a status area. Since nearly every GUI
Presenter will use at least the status area, this means nearly every new GUI
Presenter should subclass from <code>GUIStandardPresenter</code>. In this way,
we can keep improving this one class and get the results everywhere, instead
of having to make parallel changes in a set of classes. It might even be worth
someone's time someday to convert the relic classes over, but so far this
has not seemed worth the tradeoff of time lost and potential bugs introduced.
</P>

<a name="minimizingIFC">
<H2>Minimizing IFC</H2>
</a>

<P>Microcosm suffers from requiring too much memory. IFC has many classes we
don't use at all, and lots of unused code in the classes we do use. Putting
these two sentences together leads inexorably to the conclusion that
Microcosm would be better off if we had a pared-down version of IFC that
only included the stuff we actually use. Even better, we could throw out
a lot more code and reduce the class count by another 20 or 30 by merging
the code in <code>ec.ifc.app</code> and <code>ec.ifc.stonelook</code>
directly into the parts of IFC that we actually use. For instance, this
allows us to delete all the drawing code that the stonelook drawing code
completely replaces.</P>

<P>Crock and Arnold pestered the good folks at Netscape until they finally
(around 2/11/98) gave in and gave us permission to do this. As long as we
aren't shipping a UI framework or toolkit that can be construed as competing
with IFC or Swing we can munge away at their code and squoosh it together
with ours. I actually got pretty far along with this before it got put on
hold due to changes in EC's plans for Microcosm. But the work I did will
have to be redone if and when we decide to do this again, due to drift in
our use of <code>netscape.application</code> and especially drift in
<code>ec.ifc.app</code> and <code>ec.ifc.stonelook</code>. Here are the steps
for "minimizing IFC" in this way:</P>

<ol>
<li>
<P><H4>Remove unused methods and classes from IFC source code</H4></P>
<P>Make a copy of the IFC source tree. Go through it, removing classes
and methods that aren't used anywhere in Microcosm. 
<A HREF="mailto:ronin@communities.com">RobL</A> has techniques for finding
unused methods. I've done a pretty good first pass on this which will probably
remain valid or very nearly so for a few months at least, so you might want
to contact me first before starting this up again.</P>
</li>

<li>
<P><H4>Create one package from minimized IFC packages</H4><P>
<P>There's not much point in maintaining the application/util split after
removing all the unused stuff from IFC, because most of the classes in
<code>netscape.util</code> can be removed entirely since they're only used
in the archiving mechanism, which we don't use. I was using <code>ec.efc</code>
as the name of the new package, but you might be able to think of a 
cleverer name. Search through the remaining source code, deleting references
to the old package names or replacing them with the new name, as appropriate.
</P>
</li>

<li>
<P><H4>Merge <code>netscape.application</code> and <code>ec.ifc.app</code> 
and <code>ec.ifc.stonelook</code></H4></P>
<P>This is the trickiest part. First, for each class in 
<code>ec.ifc.app</code>, either add it to the new package or merge its
code in with its superclass's code. Look for variables and helper methods
that are only used in code that's being replaced and delete them too. Then,
do the same thing for each class in <code>ec.ifc.stonelook</code>. Along the
way, note that there are a couple of hack/workaround classes 
<code>IFCListViewAccess</code> and <code>IFCButtonAccess</code> that can
be cleanly eliminated in this step. They currently live elsewhere in the
source tree (we put them straight into package 
<code>netscape.application</code> to get access to package-scope stuff
that our subclasses wanted). I've done a first pass at this too, but it
has already gone stale as bug fixes have been checked into 
<code>ec.ifc.app</code>. There's only hope of salvaging it if I do so in
the next couple of weeks (it's now 3/24/98), which doesn't seem likely.</P>
</li>

<li>
<P><H4>Convert callers</H4></P>
<P>After checking in the new merged package, convert callers in Microcosm to
use it. Theoretically this could be done one file at a time, but I expect
there would be some weird problems if some code used IFC and other code
used the new package (e.g. there wouldn't be one Application object that
knows about all the windows, so some window interactions might not work).
Probably it's best to try to do this all as part of one giant checkin. When
this step is done, the phrases "ifc", "netscape.", and "stonelook" should
no longer appear anywhere in our code base.</P>
</li>

<li>
<P><H4>Out with the old</H4></P>
<P>When all callers have been converted, remove the old packages from our
source tree, build environment, etc.</P>
</li>

<li>
<P><H4>Improve merged package</H4></P>
<P>At this point, we can make improvements at our leisure to the new merged
package. One that we've already thought about is using IFC's caches of
Rects, Points, and Vectors in the code that we merged in.</P>
</li>

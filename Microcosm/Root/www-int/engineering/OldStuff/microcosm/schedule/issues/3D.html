<h1>3D Space Implementation</h1>



Jay, Russ and Alan are looking at adding 3D spaces to Microcosm. For the

demo they plan to add a few discrete 3D regions - without the ability

to see into other neighbouring regions. They are looking at the Motion

Factory product, which could be a valuable addition to the dynamics

engine.



<p>



Their project is fairly self contained and does not depend on or

affect the progress of the rest of the demo (with the exception of

Harry's dynamics engine). They feel confident they can get something

in time for the demo, though they're not yet sure what the space will

look like or how fully featured it will be.



<p>



In the longer term 3D will have more impact on the design of Microcosm.

In addition to the many UI issues there are important engineering issues:



<ul>



<li> Discrete regions don't make so much sense in a 3D world. In the current

Microcosm you can't interact with or see people in adjacent regions. In a 3D

world you expect to be able to see through doorways (or into the distance, if

you're in a large space). This may affect the architecture of higher layers

of Microcosm.



<li> Large 3D spaces will introduce scaling issues. Scale issues have

been considered in Microcosm (e.g. in the design for performances,

where a large crowd can get together to watch a performance). Maybe

the work for large 3D spaces can reuse some of the existing designs.



</ul>

  <LI>Time estimates in the schedule are in full person days i.e. assuming
full time work on the task (in practice with meetings etc. you're
probably going to get around 4 full person days per person per 5 day
week(?)). Time estimates also have a &quot;certainty&quot; rating -
soft, medium or firm. Soft means there are still a lot of unknowns,
medium means a few unknowns and firm means the task is well
understood.
  <LI>The architecture of the underlying platform (E, Pluribus) is still
changing. This is worrying at this stage, when we want to concentrate energy
on the Microcosm application. 
  <LI>Are our avatars going to be too big? With all the gestures, animations
etc. they may be as large as 1MB of image data. This will be too much to
load over a wire if someone has a customized avatar (it would also be a
big load on the person sending the customized avatar; if their machine hosts
their avatar in a simple client/server configuration then their machine
has to send copies of the data to everyone in the region). <A NAME="operationsNote"></A>
  <LI>Our dependancies and interations with operations are significant,
yet terrifyingly undefined at this point. 
  <LI>We need to define 3D and organize the tasks with more granularity
and certainty. 
  <LI>The bsd-db database we are using for the repository is not crash resistant
(if the system crashes during a write the database could be corrupted).
What do we do about this?

Java VM Requirements</H1>
<B>Last updated:</B><I> [98/0527 <A HREF="../../cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A>]</I>

Introduction</H2>
The characteristics of the Java Virtual Machine we will ship with can (and
probably will) have a significant impact on the design of higher level
parts of our system. This document is intended as a central clearing point
for those features which are promised in future versions of the JVM that
we might be able to use.

<P>As a goal, we'd like to be on top of the VM current at the point that
we 'freeze' our code (<I>i.e.</I> at the end of RobJ's first stack of infrastructure
milestones).

<I>(Optional) list any related design documents</I>

Requirements</H2>
1. java.lang.ref

<P>The current resource management pre-design could make good use of the
various "weak" references so that reference counting etc. can be avoided.
This won't be available until 1.2 (all the current IDEs are only/barely
up to 1.1.5, let alone 1.1.6).
<H4>
Open Issues</H4>
<I>This section of the document is used by the authors and moderator to
store any incomplete information - issues identified during a design inspection
but not yet resolved (the task list), notes that aren't ready to be put
into the main text, etc.</I>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The avatar directory is a mechanism for hub members to contact
other registered members of the hub. Currently, the avatar
directory lists &quot;avatars&quot; and the user name associated
with that avatar.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Directory is presented on the web.</li>
    <li>Presentl registered avatars in the member db.</li>
    <li>Provide a &quot;link&quot;, an href, that when clicked
        on, opens the address book page for that avatar.</li>
    <li>Provide a way to teleport to that avatar's turf.
        (Currently not implemented, though one can get to the
        turf via the address book page, if the avatar is online.)</li>
    <li>Store the latest contents of the avatar's address book
        &quot;me&quot; page in the database. (Not implemented.)</li>
    <li>Display an indicator showing if that avatar is online.
        (Not implemented.)</li>
    <li>Turf Directories: Allow user's to publish a link to their
        turf on a web page. (Implemented, but not being used.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h4>Current Architecture Overview</h4>

<p>The architecture for the Avatar directory is rather
straightforward.</p>

<ul>
    <li>When a user's &quot;adds&quot; an avatar to the member db
        (via the hub/realm registration mechanism), the avatar
        identity sturdy ref and avatar name is added to the
        &quot;Idenities&quot; table in the member db schema.</li>
    <li>The Avatar Directory is accessed either by clicking on an
        in-world object (which launches a web URL), or by
        navigating on the web to the Directory URL.</li>
    <li>The Avatar Directory is actually implemented as an Active
        Server Page (ASP), which runs on the server side and
        generates HTML content.</li>
    <li>The ASP performs two functions: 1) to show the entire
        directory, and 2) provide the &quot;mcm&quot; content
        when the user clicks on the avatar href.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Displaying the entire directory</h5>

<p>If the Avatar Directory URL is invoked without parameters
(i.e. a query string isnt specified), then the entire directory
is displayed. The steps the Avatar Directory ASP implements for
displaying the Directory List are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Connect to the member db.</li>
    <li>Query the db for all avatars in the avatar table, and the
        first name/last name fields from the account table for
        each avatar. This is a simple SQL query: <br>
        <br>
        <font size="2" face="Courier">SELECT
        identities.avatarName, identities.id, identies.identEARL,
        persons.fname, persons.lname <br>
        FROM identities, persons <br>
        WHERE persons.id = identities.id ORDER BY persons.lname<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font size="3">When the results are returned from the
        database, the ASP simply processes these results and
        formats the output in the form of an html table. The
        avatar name is placed in an HREF tag, where the URL is an
        HREF to the ASP with a query string. The query string
        parameters are the indenty EARL and the avatar name. For
        example (spaces added to improve readability):<br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Courier">&lt; A HREF</font><font
        size="1" face="Courier"> = default.asp ? e = {ident EARL}
        &amp; n = {avatar name} &gt; </font><font size="2"
        face="Courier">{avatar name} &lt; / A &gt;</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        <br>
        where </font><font size="2" face="Courier">{ident EARL}</font><font
        size="3"> is the EARL string returned from the query and </font><font
        size="2" face="Courier">{avatar name}</font><font
        size="3"> is the avatar name, also returned from the
        query.</font></li>
</ol>

<h5>Displaying an individual avatar address book page</h5>

<p>If the user selects one of the avatar HREFs, then the ASP will
be invoked with the optional &quot;e&quot; and &quot;n&quot;
parameters. In this case, the ASP simply builds a string
containing the MCM file content and responds with a content type
of <font size="2" face="Courier">application/x-microcosm</font><font
size="3">, and the MCM file content. When the browser receives
this content, it will see the content type and laucnh habi-cosm.
Habi-cosm will then get the MCM file and open the address book
page (or create a blank one) for the identity specified in the
MCM file content.</font></p>

<h4>Proposed Architecture Overview</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Use an LDAP server. A couple pieces of software would be
        needed: <ol>
            <li>An LDAP server would need to be installed. There
                is some support for directories included in
                Windows NT Server, however that implementation
                may be inappropriate. There is a &quot;free&quot;
                LDAP server from the University of Michigan,
                however we would need to investigate the license
                issue. Alternatively, a minimal LDAP server could
                be built on top of SqlServer or another database.
                The Univ of Mich LDAP server builds on top of
                NDBM or GDBM, which are flat file database
                implementations available on Unix. NDBM is
                bundled with Solaris; GDBM is GNU software.</li>
            <li>LDAP/Web-server integration: These must exist,
                though I have no leads as of today.</li>
            <li>LDAP/Java integration: JNDI seems like the
                appropriate mechanism for this.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>An LDAP approach may be attractive to customers.</li>
    <li>LDAP provides a more general solution for directory
        services, hence Turf and Object directories are also
        possible.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Off the shelf alternatives</h4>

<p>The LDAP approach would use alot of off-the-shelf
technologies, though the risk would be that these technologies
are not mature. However, given the somewhat straightforward
requirements of the directory services, its possible that what's
available is sufficent.</p>

<p>The current implementation using the SqlServer DB and an ASP
is also very much off-the-shelf. Though maybe more lightweight
than an LDAP approach, the current approach suffers from not
being general enough. E.g., we can't easily use it for Turf
Directories.</p>

<h4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<p><i>Lists any special objectives and assumptions of the code
e.g. reusability, thread safety, security, performance, use of
resources, compatibility with existing code etc. This section
gives important context for reviewers</i> </p>

<h2>Current implementation</h2>

<h4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</h4>

<p>The Avatar Directory ASP currently lives with the beta web
content.</p>

<h4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</h4>

<p>No. Actually, there isnt much Java code involved in the Avatar
Directory implementation. The ASP is written Visual Basic. Java
is also available, however error handling with respect to
database queries using Java is weak compared to the Visual Basic
error handling. The ASP code is documented.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>See <a href="http://www.communities.com/directories/">http://www.communities.com/directories/</a></p>

<h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>

<p>No testing and debugging utilities were developed to debug the
directory. This is actually a simple ASP problem.</p>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<h4>Resolved Issues</h4>

<h4>Open Issues</h4>

<p>There is currently one Avatar Directory for both realms (city
and beach). This is because the two realms share the same member
database, and there is no indicator in the database schema to
indicate if an avatar registration (i.e. add avatar) is being
added for the city or beach realm. Seperate registration, yet
sharing the same member DB needs to be considered as a
requirement.</p>

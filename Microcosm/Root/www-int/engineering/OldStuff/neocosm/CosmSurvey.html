<P>As part of figuring out the best way to move forward we need to understand
what we have. The application can be divided into subsystems, and we need
to survey them and the code that we have. Doing this will help get a good
comprehensive plan of the work ahead.

<P>If you are documenting a subsystem please use the <A HREF="SubsystemDocTemplate.html">Subsystem
Document Template</A>.

<P>Once we have sorted out who will be working on which subsystems we will
need to define requirements, issues, and decide on the future of legacy
code, identifying carefully what is the functionality that we need, as
well as possible alternatives.

no need to change the native code. The Java wrappers would need to change

<I>It looks plausible that we could just use the NetMeeting SDK instead
of TNT's VoxChat (which is no longer supported at all, and thus basically
unshippable).&nbsp; The problem would then be, as it currently is, using
chat while listening to sounds; we don't know if DirectSound coexists any
better with NetMeeting's call API than it did with VoxChat (which was "not").</I></LI>

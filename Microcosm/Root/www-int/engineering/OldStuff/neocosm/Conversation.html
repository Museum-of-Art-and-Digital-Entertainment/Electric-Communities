Conversation interactswith Containership to keep its own list of clients.<P>This is more complicated than necessary.<H4><A NAME="Proposed Architecture Overview"></A>ProposedArchitecture Overview</H4><P>Replace the two kinds of host-only unums with a singleConversation unum, the client part dealing with the IO, and the hostpart doing the propagation, working more in the style of regularingredients. This removes the tight coupling with Containership andsimplifies the code.<P>A wilder proposal is to make Conversation function more likeTelepathy, if it turns out that that makes it possible to integrateconversation with a The Palace product.<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4><P>&nbsp;<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4><P>&nbsp;<H2>Current implementation</H2><H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4><P>cosm1/objects/ingredients/Conversation<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4><P>Yes, by Trevor.<H4>Examples</H4><P>&nbsp;<H4>Testing and Debugging</H4><P>&nbsp;<H4>Uses ewhen and etry</H4><P>Yes.<H2>Design Issues</H2><H4>Resolved Issues</H4><P>It works.

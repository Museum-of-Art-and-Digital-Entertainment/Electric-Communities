<H1><I>Encode/Decode</I></H1>

<P>Last updated: [1998/05/13 Bill Frantz] </P>

<P>Author(s): Bill Frantz. </P>

<P>Subsystem originally written by Gordie Freedman. </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The Encode/Decode system transforms an object so it can be passed to
another vat thru the <A HREF="CommSystemOverview.html">Comm System</A>.
Since Encode/Decode only processes pass by copy objects, the Encode/Decode
system must interface with the Comm System's export/import logic which
implements pass by proxy. The Encode/Decode system can either use the standard
encoding, or allow a class to specify its own encoding. </P>

<H4>Related Documents</H4>

<P>None that I know of (wsf) </P>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<P>Requirements currently implemented: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Encode/Decode a graph of objects starting with a root object.</LI>

<LI>Ensure that objects that encode themselves do not silently corrupt
the encoding of other objects in the graph.</LI>

<LI>Supports &quot;Uniquely encodable&quot; objects, whatever that means.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Requirements at best partially implemented: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Allow for version up/down grade of objects passed by copy. NOT TESTED!</LI>
</UL>

<P>Pure dumb things that need to be fixed: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Support for encode/decode to/from disk should be removed. It will make
the code easier to read, smaller, and a bit faster.</LI>

<LI>Methods which aren't being used should be eliminated or commented out
to make the code easier to understand.</LI>

<LI>The file names need to be made the same as the class names. The class
RtStandardEncoder being found in ec/e/db/RtEncoder.java and the interface
RtEncoder being found in ec/e/run/RtInterfaces.java just drive me up the
wall (wsf).</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<P>TBD - wsf </P>

<P><I>Diagrams are strongly encouraged; a few diagrams can do wonders for
clairifying an architecture. If you don't know how to add diagrams consult
Lani and Amy.</I> </P>

<H4>Current Architecture Overview</H4>

<P>An instance of RtStandardEncoder is associated with each instance of
MsgSender. Likewise, an instance of RtStandardDecoder is associated with
each instance of MsgReceiver. They cooperate to encode/decode objects for
transmission thru the comm system. </P>

<P>The MsgSender/MsgReceiver handles objects that are passed by proxy.
RtStandardEncoder/RtStandardDecoder encodes/decodes objects that are passed
by copy which don't encode themselves. </P>

<P>StreamDB is used to interface with the opener system to read/set the
contents of the objects being encoded/decoded. RtStandardEncoder/RtStandardDecoder
passes itself to StreamDB as the RtEncoder/RtDecoder interface to provide
the recursive invocation which encodes a whole graph of objects. </P>

<H4>Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>

<P><I>This section is not urgent for the first version of this document,
you should capture what direction you feel this subsystem ought to take.
As we start addressing specific systems this section will grow into the
core of the design document.</I> </P>

<H4>Off the shelf alternatives</H4>

<P>Java serialization. </P>

<H4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>

<P><I>Lists any special objectives and assumptions of the code e.g. reusability,
thread safety, security, performance, use of resources, compatibility with
existing code etc. This section gives important context for reviewers</I>
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Current implementation</FONT></B> </P>

<P>See <A HREF="EncodeDecodeXref_r167.html">External Interface for ec.e.db
in r167</A> for a list of external references into the ec.e.db package.
</P>

<P>RtEncoderDataOutputStream and RtDecoderDataInputStream handle the process
of converting primitive Java types (int, float, String etc.) to bytes for
transmission. They perform compression/expansion on the data as it is placed
in the stream. </P>

<P>MsgSender implements the interface RtEncodingManager and MsgReceiver
implements RtDecodingManager. These interfaces define the interface between
encode/decode and the msg system. </P>

<P>All the new classes referenced in an envelope are sent as a separate
E protocol message before the message which refers to them. This technique
requires special methods in the Msg layer. </P>

<H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>

<P>This subsystem has important defintions in the following directories.
It should not be assumed that all the classes in these directories are
part of this subsystem. </P>

<UL>
<LI>ec4/javasrc/ec/e/db</LI>

<LI>ec4/javasrc/ec/e/run</LI>

<LI>ec4/javasrc/ec/e/stream</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>

<P>Some of the classes and methods have Javadoc comments. </P>

<H4>Examples</H4>

<P><I>Are there examples?</I> </P>

<H4>Testing and Debugging</H4>

<P><I>(Optional) Lists any tests and debugging utilities which are to be
developed to help test the design (e.g. test classes, trace categories,
etc)</I> </P>

<H2>Design Issues</H2>

<H4>Resolved Issues</H4>

<P><I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I> </P>

<H4>Open Issues</H4>

<P>Class table changes can be included in the envelope encoding as a &quot;define
new class&quot; entry. This change would eliminate a bunch of mechanism.
</P>

<P>We should look at integrating the encode/decode functions of the Comm
system Msg layer with RtStandardEncoder/RtStandardDecoder. </P>

<P>Every time we send a message to a remote object, we identify it by its
full swiss number. If we maintain a table of these numbers, we can encode
the swiss number as an index in the table, compressing the information
from 8 bytes (or 16 if we change the swiss numbers) to one or two. </P>

<P>Walendo says: Hey Bill, I was just thinking that the comm system diagnostics
(which objects were being encoded, how many bytes are going over the wire,
etc) were key in figuring out some of our transition problems. I just wanted
to make the request that you allocate time to put these very useful features
into the new comm system as well. </P>

<P><I>This section of the document is used by the authors and moderator
to store any incomplete information - issues identified during a design
inspection but not yet resolved (the task list), notes that aren't ready
to be put into the main text, etc.</I> <BR>

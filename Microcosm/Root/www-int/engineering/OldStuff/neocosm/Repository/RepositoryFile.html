<H2>Introduction</H2>
[<I>98/06/30 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>]
A RepositoryFile is an implementation of the
<A HREF="Repository.html#Repository">Repository interface</A> which sits
(at this point) on top of a RandomAccessFile of data.  The
writeable version will store new information in tables which can then be
written out on command; if you don't add anything to such a repository,
no re-writing of the file needs to be done; if you add only a few things,
updating the file is a quick append operation.

<H2>Architecture</H2>

<H4><a name="PAO">Proposed Architecture Overview</A></H4>

[<I>98/07/08 <A HREF="mailto:karl@communities.com">Karl</A></I>] The
Repository file is ultimately a RandomAccessFile containing the raw data
and the various informational data about it, all indexed by the
CryptoHash of the raw data.  I will probably have an interface (say
RepositoryFiling) which extends the Repository interface.  Then there will
be 2 classes (RepositoryFile and WriteableRepositoryFile).  These three
Java Objects will form the basis for interacting with Repository files.

<ul>
<a name="RepositoryFiling"></a>
<li>interface <b>RepositoryFiling</b>
	<ul>
	<li>extends <A HREF="Repository.html#Repository">Repository</A>
	<li>defines final ints describing types of data (HINTS, CERTIFICATES,
	BITMAP, APPEARANCE2D, WAVEFILE, etc.)
	<li>getting and caching data by CryptoHash
	<li>reading/flushing all data into/from Hashtables
	<li>reading/flushing specific types of data into/from Hashtables
	</ul>
<a name="WriteableRepositoryFiling"></a>
<li>interface <b>WriteableRepositoryFiling</b>
	<ul>
	<li>extends <A HREF="#RepositoryFiling">RepositoryFiling</A>
	<li>extends <A HREF="Repository.html#WriteableRepository">WriteableRepository</A>
	<li>adding data, hints and certificates
	<li>deleting data, hints and certificates
	<li>updating file
	<li>rewriting file
	</ul>
<a name="RepositoryFile"></a>
<li>class <b>RepositoryFile</b>
	<ul>
	<li>implements <b>RepositoryFiling</b>
	<li>contains a RandomAccessFile of data
	<li>contains a Hashtable of data locations in the file
	<li>reads location data from the RandomAccessFile into the Hashtable upon construction
	</ul>
<a name="WriteableRepositoryFile"></a>
<li>class <b>WriteableRepositoryFile</b>
	<ul>
	<li>extends <b>RepositoryFile</b>
	<li>implements <A HREF="#WriteableRepositoryFiling">WriteableRepositoryFiling</A>
	<li>contains Hashtables for original data, hints and certificates
	<li>contains Hashtables for added data, hints and certificates
	<li>contains Hashtables for deleted data, hints and certificates
	<li>updates (appends) data from added Hashtables out to file
	<li>rewrites (compacts) a file, deleting unused data, hints, etc.
	</ul>
</ul>

<a name="FileFormat">

The file contains raw data, CryptoHashes, hints and certificates,
<A HREF="RepositoryRequirements.html#TrackExtraInfo">extra information</A>,
along with pointers to new sets of data as described below.  The basic format
is simply:

<OL>
<LI>A "secret" number (a long integer) indicating this is a Repository file
<LI>The version number (an integer) of the RepositoryFile (changes when/if
the format does)
<LI>The number (a long integer) of unique CryptoHashes in the file
<LI>Pairs of 1). a location table and 2). a list of Repository data
</OL>

A location table consists of:

<OL>
<LI>The number of entries (a long integer) in the table
<LI>Zero or more sets of location data:
<OL>
<LI>A CryptoHash (16 bytes)
<LI>The file location (long integer) of the raw data
<LI>The file location (long integer) of the first hints Vector
<LI>The file location (long integer) of the first Certificates Vector
<LI>The file location (long integer) of the first set of
<A HREF="RepositoryRequirements.html#TrackExtraInfo">extra information</A>
<LI>The character length (integer) of the original file name
<LI>The original file name as a String
</OL>
<LI>The file location (a long integer) of the next location table
</OL>

Lists of Repository data consist of zero or more sets of the following:

<OL>
<LI>The CryptoHash to associate this data with (16 bytes)
<LI>An int indicating the type of data (HINTS, CERTIFICATES, BITMAP, etc.)
<LI>The size (a long integer) in bytes of this data
<LI>The data itself as raw bytes (just bytes or serialized Vectors)
<LI>The file location (a long integer) of the next set of this type of
data for this CryptoHash
</OL>

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>If the long integer which is a file location is zero, then there is
no more data of that type in the file.  For example, if "The file
location (long integer) of the hints Vector" is zero, there are no more
hints for this CryptoHash. Similarly, if "The file location (a long
integer) of the next location table" is zero, there is no further table.
Also note that the file location of the next set of "raw data" will always
be zero--There can only be one set of raw bytes.

<LI>If the size in bytes of some raw data is zero, then the actual data
is not in this Repository file, but there should be some hints available
under the same CryptoHash which could be used to track the data down.

<LI>If the size in bytes of any data element is negative, then the data
has been "deleted" but this file has not yet been compacted.

<LI>Raw data will be just that, a series of bytes.  Hints and
Certificates will be written out as serialized Vectors.

<LI>At this point [98/06/30], the
<A HREF="RepositoryRequirements.html#TrackExtraInfo">extra information</A>
is as described by <A HREF="mailto:tony@communities.com">Tony</A>.  My plan
(thanks to <A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A> for the original
idea) is to just treat such information as raw bytes and it's up to whoever
stored it to parse it out into something useful.  This way we don't have
to worry about what format such extra information should take or what
kinds of information should be included.  The inclusion of such extra
information will cover Tony's desire for some
<A HREF="RepositoryRequirements.html#Reporting">reporting</A> functionality.
</OL>

<P>New CryptoHash additions to a
<A HREF="#WriteableRepositoryFile">WriteableRepositoryFile</A> cause a new
location table to be appended to a file, followed by the new data. The
updating of hints, Certificates or extra info of  already extant raw
data entries results in the appending of said data to the end of the
file, followed by the update of the (previously zero) "pointers" after
the old data to the the file location of the new serialized Vectors or
extra info bytes. Appending is quicker than rewriting the entire file,
so we can get our "speedy" updates this way.
</P>
<P>Deleted items will have their sizes set to negative values (see the Java
classes defined below) rather than being removed and causing rewrites of
the entire file. The "rewrite/compact" method of the <A
HREF="#WriteableRepositoryFile">WriteableRepositoryFile</A> will rewrite
the entire file, omitting "deleted" items and thus compacting the file.
If a Repository file is "rewritten", such entries will not be written
out, and will not exist in the new version.

	<OL>
	<LI>Is a RandomAccessFile really the way to go, or would just a stream of
	bytes be a better alternative?
	<LI></A>Are Hashtables the right Objects for the job of storing the data in
	memory, or is there a better way?

What sort of reports do we want to generate from the extra information and how.

Object-level Multicast Support in Neocosm</H1>
<B>Last updated:</B><I> [98/05/24 <A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob</A>]</I>
Author: <A HREF="mailto:cobblers@communities.com">Bob Schumaker</A>.
<H2>
Introduction</H2>
Many of the interactions between distributed objects in the current version
of Cosm would be simplified if the collection of "target" objects could
be specified as a group. This document describes an extension to the current
"proxy" object model that supports an arbitrary group abstraction and hides
the details of the underlying multicast implementation (if any).
<H2>
Requirements</H2>

<OL>
<LI>
Diverse group or "session" semantics should be supported without changing
the basic interface.</LI>

<LI>
The API should be "simple" -- the details of exactly how the group is maintained
should be hidden from its clients, allowing improvements to be made over
time as we more fully understand the problems involved.</LI>

<LI>
If possible, the first implementation should provide primitive group semantics
using the current underlying communication system.</LI>

<LI>
The API should not tie us to any given underlying multicast support so
that we can move to new standard technologies as they become available.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
Architecture</H2>
Object-level multicast is provided by an Object that implements the <TT>Group</TT>
interface. It is this object that determines the state of the group as
a whole (membership, primarily, although the group may tell its clients
that it is no longer effectively a group at any time). In addition, the
<TT>Group</TT> will provide its clients with a <TT>Sendable</TT> that will
reach all the members of the group (within the limitations of the group
itself, an unreliable group may not make any guarantees on message delivery).
<H4>
Current Architecture Overview</H4>
Currently, all multicast semantics are handled at the top levels of object
in the system, <I>i.e</I>. those objects that deal with group semantics
maintain their own group state internally -- there is no shared "group
concept." The purpose of the Multicast Group subsystem is to concentrate
all of the group membership information and behavior underneath a common
interface.
<H4>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>
The Multicast Group object, upon request, provide a proxy interface to
the rest of the system, since it is, in effect, a proxy for the group.
As different strategies for determining group membership become necessary,
subclasses can be implemented to support those strategies. The initial
implementation will most likely be a collection of point-to-point connections
and will maintain a simple status of which endpoints are currently connected.
Since the Multicast Group object is a first class object, it can eventually
be a distributed object in its own right, and could conceivably implement
multicast semantics on its own without any support from the underlying
comm system.
<H4>
Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
Scott's <A HREF="DObjects.html">DObject</A> '<A HREF="dobjects/dom/docs/dom.session.View.html">dom.session.View</A>'
class provides some of the same functionality, but with a different abstraction.
<H4>
Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
The main design objective of the Multicast Group subsystem is to wrap session
and group semantics inside an object with a well defined interface and
behavior, isolating the entire distributed object system from the underlying
communication system details necessary to support it. This will allow us
to develop objects that rely on multicast support well before we have low-level
comm system support for "true" multicast (and, in fact, we never need to
implement low-level multicast if it proves infeasible).
<H2>
Proposed implementation</H2>
Groups define the <TT>Group</TT> interface and internally maintain their
own state. State changes may be reported to interested parties, but the
group itself is responsible for determining 'significant' changes (<I>i.e.</I>
details of maintaining group membership are hidden inside the implementation
of the group). Additions and deletions from the group may also be made
by external agents (<I>e.g.</I> a region adding avatars to a region).

<P>The messaging interface to a group is provided by an object that implements
<A HREF="../API_doc/ec4/ec.elib.prim.Sendable.html">Sendable</A>, with
one change — the <A HREF="../API_doc/ec4/ec.elib.prim.Sendable.html#sendAll(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object[])">SendAll</A>
method throws and exception (trying to get a result back from a group is
not a valid operation). From the point of view of client objects, there
are no other differences between a point-to-point connection and a group
connection as far as interface.

Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
<I>For example ec4/javasrc/ec/...</I>
<H4>
Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>
<I>In many cases, this section can link to JavaDoc output from actual Java
classes and interfaces. This saves writing documentation twice (the designers
will have to JavaDoc their interfaces anyway). The JavaDoc should be linked
into the design document. <A HREF="../tools/javadoc.html">Chip's JavaDoc
style guidelines</A> explain how to use JavaDoc effectively.</I>
<H4>
Examples</H4>
<I>Are there examples?</I>
<H4>
Testing and Debugging</H4>
<I>(Optional) Lists any tests and debugging utilities which are to be developed
to help test the design (e.g. test classes, trace categories, etc.)</I>

Design Issues</H2>

<H4>
Resolved Issues</H4>
<I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I>
<H4>
Open Issues</H4>
[5/26/98 Bill] Based on the last white board discussions, the design for
the Multicast object calls for it to only support the non-status reporting
version of send. However it uses the status reporting versions to learn
when clients leave the group. This approach will prevent these objects
from being cascaded.

<I>Basic Una Support -- Realm and Region</I></H1>

Introduction</H2>
The realm and region are two 'special' una. The realm is a host-only unum…i.e.
it creates no client presences. It is also an unum that is purely abstract…i.e.
it is not intended to have any visual or other in-world representation,
but rather serves purely administrative and other 'meta' functions. It
also meant to represent a grouping of regions that share common terms of
service. It has only a few ingredients: an identity ingredient (it has
an identity so it can be uniquely identified), a BasicContainer ingredient
(used as a neighbor for the RegionContainer ingredient), a RegionContainer
ingredient (meant to represent access to all the region una that the realm
currently contains), and a RealmTOSPeer ingredient (the code for responding
to region requests for realm tos entry approval).

<P>The region unum is much more complicated. It has an identity ingredient,
a BasicContainable ingredient (an ingredient correspondng to the BasicContainer
ingredient within the realm), a RegionContainable ingredient (an ingredient
to represent the fact that the region is a containable of the realm), and
a TOSPeer ingredient (the code responsible for region-level tos checks,
and for also making tos check requests of the region's container realm).
It also has a great many other ingredients, the most important of which
are the containership ingredients (see Rob's description of the containership
structure), and the ingredients for representing the region's behavior
(RegionBehavior, BehaviorManager, VerbManager, RootCompositor). These other
ingredients are documented elsewhere. This document will focus on the region's
relationship with the realm.

Requirements</H2>
For the realm/region una and their relationship, the requirements are as
follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Support for a host-only realm that is able to communicate at run time with
all of its known regions.</LI>

<LI>
Support for a region that is able to communicate at run time with its known
realm.</LI>

<LI>
Support for region and realm una hosts to be located on different processes
(hosted in different vats).</LI>

<LI>
Support for regions to be added and removed from their containing realm
at run time, while maintaining consistent information on both sides about
the state of the region&lt;->realm relationship.</LI>

<LI>
Support for arbitrary TOS restrictions on entering avatars (identified
by their unique identities) at both the region and realm level (i.e. regions
can have restrictions on entry distinct from realm-level restrictions,
and both are invoked at avatar entry time).</LI>

<LI>
Support for restrictions on the number of allowed avatars at both the region
and realm level.</LI>

<LI>
Support for TOS locking and unlocking (allow/disallow entry) at both the
region and realm level.</LI>

<LI>
Support for properties sheet access to the viewing and setting of region
and realm parameters</LI>

<LI>
Support for the realm recording and providing definitive access to the
teleport pads exposed by the regions it contains</LI>

<LI>
Support the avatar access to administrative capabilities (i.e. modifying
the TOS policies of the realm at runtime, through the AvatarRealmAdmin
ingredient in the avatar).</LI>
</OL>

<H2>
Architecture</H2>
<A HREF="realmregion.gif">&nbsp;</A><B>Current Architecture Overview</B>

<P><A HREF="realmregion.gif">Here is a picture of the realm/region architecture</A>

<P>The realm/region containment architecture is set up to be provide a
generic containment relationship between the realm and 1 or more regions
that are 'owned' by that realm. The two ingredients responsible for setting
up and breaking down this relationship are the RegionContainer (a realm
ingredient) and the RegionContainable (a region ingredient). These two
ingredients exchange E messages to 'add' and 'remove' regions from the
set of those currently contained by the realm. Note the protocol is such
that it could support having realm and region hosts be located on different
processes and still work properly, although we currently are not doing
this. The RegionContainer depends upon code located in the BasicContainer
ingredient, and the RegionContainable depends upon code in the BaseContainable.
Both the realm and the region have a 'TOSPeer' ingredient, which invokes
the respective entry policy checks for the region and the realm. Note that
the region's TOSPeer ingredient communicates with the containership ingredient.
It receives notifications of entry requests, does a local check, gets a
facet to the RealmTOSPeer ingredient (via the RegionContainable ingredient),
sends the request to the RealmTOSPeer ingredient, and passes the results
back to the containership ingredient. This provides TOS checking prior
to actual entry that is handled by the containership ingredient.
<H4>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>
Same as above. This architecture is working OK now, and should provide
the needed generality for future uses.
<H4>
Off the shelf alternatives</H4>
None.
<H4>
Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</H4>
Some other design objectives: 1) Provide the means for a region to send
arbitrary messages to its realm when needed. For example, when an avatar
needs to get a hold of the realm 'map' URL (the URL identifying the web
page for the realm map), it makes a request first of the region that contains
it. The region then forwards this request onto its realm (via the RegionContainable/RegionContainer
ingredients), and the realm provides the map URL back in response to this
request. A similar messaging pathway is taken for requests to cache a list
of teleport pads known to the realm (such caching is done by the AvatarRealmAdmin
ingredient). This basic mechanism can be used for other and other desired/needed
kinds of communication between the region and the realm without setting
up other specific relationships.
<H2>
Current implementation</H2>
<I>Yes.</I> <FONT FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT> I'm not sure whether it's necessary
to go over the details of the current implementation in this document.
If I get feedback that it is, I will gladly flesh this out. I'm not sure,
however, that this architecture will receive sufficient scrutiny to justify
a detailed explanation in this document.

Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
The sources for the RegionContainer, BasicContainer, RegionContainable,
BasicContainable ingredients are in cosm1/objects/ingredients/*.plu. Most
of these sources are javadoced.

<P>The sources for the TOS peer ingredients are in cosm1/objects/ingredients/tos/*.plu.
Most of these sources are javadoced.

<P>The sources for the containership ingredient is in cosm1/objects/ingredients/containership
<H4>
Examples</H4>
An example usage of the region to realm link:

<P>The region exposes an interface for avatars to get the realm 'map' URL
(exposed by the RegionContainable ingredient). The AvatarInterface ingredient
uses this interface exposed by the region to ask for and receive the realm's
map url. As described above, the messaging path is actually: AvatarInterface->RegionContainable->RealmFacet->RegionContainer,
which then forwards the result to the provided distributor.
<H4>
Testing and Debugging</H4>
It might be useful to have some testing of the Realm/Region add/remove
protocols, and the way they handle different failure conditions, but only
if we move to having realms and regions hosted on different processes.

<h2>Present at Meeting</h2>

<h2>Meeting Process</h2>

We started the meeting by talking about how the meetings have been going
and how they should proceed.

<p>
I was worried the previous meetings had "shut people out" - that
people hadn't been able to get their point heard when they wanted
to. But, when asked, everyone present thought that the only
difficulties had been those you'd expect at any large meeting; it's
always going to be harder to get your say if more people are in a
meeting. (By the way, in the rest of this meeting I thought people
were very careful to let people have their say, without interrupting).
<p>
We all agreed that we needed to move to a smaller group (or smaller
groups) when we start doing design. But larger groups are good for
getting shared understanding and scoping the problem, which is what
we are doing right now.
<p>
We also need to set time limits for meetings (we did for this meeting
and it still ran over, but only by 10 minutes or so).


<h2>Requirements Discussion</h2>

<h4>The problem we discussed</h4>

The entire meeting was spent on the first requirement on our "to
be discussed" list:
<p>
"An object should not be contained by some container without consent
from both the object and the container i.e. both container and object
have to agree that the object is in the container; either the
container or the object can veto the relationship."
<p>
The main point we discovered was the tension between this and our
first agreed upon requirement (which we clarified slightly):
<p>
"A region provides a shared "space" in which all objects recursively
and openly contained by the region are visible to some set of
viewers. Both the objects and the viewers can be distributed across
the network i.e. the authoratitive state of N objects in a region may
be on N different machines."
<p>
The "shared space" requirement is one of the big problems Scott's
DObject work solves i.e. managing sessions of distributed objects. This
alone is a hard problem. The "consenting container/containee" is also
fairly hard. But combining them both is much harder because you have
two distributed structures that have to be kept in synch (e.g. if
avatar Fred holds a table which has a book on it, and then Fred moves
to another region, the book has to change region too).
<p>
One realization is that this problem would be trivial if all the
objects were hosted on the same machine and could communicate
synchronously and reliably. As Scott points out, some trivial problems
become hard or impossible when distributed across the network.


<h4>Example</h4>

We spent a lot of time looking at diagrams of a containership tree
(more of a twig really) where A openly contains B which openly
contains C (e.g. A's an avatar holding a table B containing a book
C). Suppose A, B and C are all hosted on different machines. What
happens when A moves into a region R, on yet another machine? R has to
know about the A, B, C relationships in order to show A, B and C to
all viewers of the region. So that means that R has to have
relationships with A, B and C. We discussed how these relationships
should be established and maintained. We referred to the different
relationships as "blue" and "green" lines according to our diagram;
that doesn't help here so I'll refer to them as "containership" and
"session" relationships. E.g. B and C would have a containership
relationship because B contains C. R would have session relationships
with both B and C because they're in the same session.


<h4>Introducing a tree into a new region</h4>

Thinking how the relationships are established made us realize how
much a container controls its containees, even things it recursively
contains. If A moves to region R, then B and C are relying on A to
perform the introduction to R (and all of A, B and C are relying on R
to introduce them to the viewers of R). This also gives lots of
opportunity for "men in the middle".
<p>
For example, a well behaved A, on entering R, will introduce B
(contained in A) to R. But it could introduce B to something that
looks like R but is, in fact, under A's control. B could short circuit
directly to R and do an equality check, but only if B has some idea of
which region it "should" be in. This lead to a discussion of identity;
if both B and R had an identity then it would make more sense for B to
have an idea of what region it "should" be in. MarkM thought that
ownership would drive the need for identity; until we have identity
props don't really need identity (though Scott could see some uses
even without ownership).


<h4>Maintaining multiple relationships</h4>

So we have the containership relationships and the session
relationships, and they're related i.e. The region R has a session
relationship with C because A is in R and A openly contains B which
contains C. All the relationships here are distributed.
<p>
One worry is what happens if one part of the linked relationships
fails, due to network partition? e.g. What if the session relationship
is represented via a network link between R and C and the
containership relationship is represented via a network link between B
and C. What happens if just one of those links go down? How does the
system get to a new consistent state? It was pointed out that message
delivery patterns and network topologies needn't correspond exactly,
but network topology does have an impact on error handling (e.g.
it's much easier to understand what happens if one arm of a star
fails vs one link in a web).


<h4>The Current Protocol</h4>

We discussed the current protocol briefly. It maintains a cache
of the containership tree at each level e.g. A would cache knowledge
of B and C. On entering a region A lets R know that it contains B
and C. R then gives A "entry relationships" for A, B and C. A sets
up its own relationship with R, and passes the others on to B (which
passes C's on to C).
<p>
When a tree is being moved it is "locked" so no additions can take
place until the move is done. Things can still remove themselves from
the tree (either due to explicit action or network failure). But
handling this is deferred until the move is complete. e.g. suppose the
machine hosting C dies while the A, B, C tree is moving into R.  A
still tells R about A, B and C. But when the R to C relationship is
set up and propogated down to C an error will occur, and the usual
clean up will take place.
<p>
Eric proposed a very similar scheme, without the emphasis on cacheing
and atomicity, but keeping the approach of propogating changes up and
down the tree.
<p>
Bill wondered about a scheme were all messages, including those to do
with the session relationship, were relayed up and down the tree. This
has the advantage of a single message path (messages from C always go
via B then A then R), which makes it clear what happens if that path
fails. But it introduces more latency and chances for man in the
middle problems.


<h4>Things to think about</h4>

Arturo suggested that it would be useful to think about two approaches
<ol>
<li>Starting with sessions and adding hierarchical containership (this
fits well with Scott's DObject work)
<li>Starting with the containership relationships and adding sessions
(this is what we did with the current containership work).
</ol>

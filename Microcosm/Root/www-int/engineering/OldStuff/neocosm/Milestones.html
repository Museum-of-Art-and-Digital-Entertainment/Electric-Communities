initial pass by RobJ, 19 May 98
<BR>third pass by RobJ, 26 May 98
<BR>under construction by <A HREF="mailto:johns@communities.com">JohnS</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:robj@communities.com">RobJ</A>
<BR>please comment early and often!!!&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>This is a third pass at a list of plausible development milestones
from now through ship.&nbsp; The first section consists of the basic infrastructure
pieces needed to make a bare-bones graphical Microcosm.&nbsp; The second
section lists a variety of feature-based milestones which add incremental
functionality on top of the bare-bones build.
<BR>Only once we have the bare-bones infrastructure (all the way out to
the user) complete will we have something that we can legitimately call
a real Neocosm (and moreover, only then do we have something that we can
clearly show people).&nbsp; So getting us there quickly yet carefully is
the main initial challenge.
<BR>Over the next few weeks, we will need to flesh these milestones out
and do scheduling of at least the first few, while coming up with projected
estimates of the remaining milestones all the way out.&nbsp; The earlier
milestones should have more accurate estimates given as we're further into
the design process for those pieces.

<P>The format here is clearly minimal, but hopefully enough to comment
on:

<A NAME="ApplicationMilestones"></A>Application Milestones</H2>
From here out is where we are off and running on features, doing self-consistent
sets of them, testing the hell out of each as we do it, all of it built
on a code base we have some confidence in.

<P>The technical milestones are "sub-application" features that aren't
necessarily directly visible to the user.&nbsp; The feature milestones
are user-visible, documented application functionality.&nbsp; The definitions
here are fuzzy but hopefully you can see what I'm getting at.&nbsp; In
any case, the point is that all these milestones are (or should be) conceptually
modular and conceptually relatively independent, and hence amenable to
reordering or reprioritizing as our customer tells us what they want most.

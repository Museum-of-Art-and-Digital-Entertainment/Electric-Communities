<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">Timeline:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">&nbsp;Let's work backwards and use some "real world"
events and dates that will affect any product we produce. This will give
us a "real" date to work to.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">December 25<SUP>th</SUP> 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">The moment we have all been waiting for. Thousands
(millions) of people rip open a present under the tree and find that they
are the proud new member of the CUSTOMER X online community. However, a
few things need to happen first.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">November 25<SUP>th</SUP> 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">This is the day after Thanksgiving and the busiest
shopping day of the year. CUSTOMER X has to have its product on the store
shelves on this day. He is counting on 2 inventory "turns" or sellouts
during this 30-day period to make his money. He has to ship the product
first.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">November 1<SUP>st</SUP> 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">This is the day that the product must ship to be
on shelves on the 25<SUP>th</SUP>. For example, Toys R Us needs at least
2 weeks just to move product from their centralized distribution centers
to their individual stores. Trucking across country in winter weather can
take many days. Before you can ship it you must first build it.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Tahoma">The service/hub [if there is one] officially
opens, and anyone who can get the software can join. All NDAs and other
protections will be lifted. This is the last possible flag day this year.
The service rolls forward from here.</FONT></I>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">September 15<SUP>th</SUP> 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">This is the day that CUSTOMER X needs to order parts
for the product such as manuals, boxes and warranty cards. These take 4
weeks to produce and then you need 2 weeks to assemble the product. At
this time of year the lead times my go out to 6 weeks and 4 weeks respectively
if the customer is a minor player in the publishing biz. Before you can
build it you need to test it.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">August 1<SUP>st</SUP> 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">This is the day that final testing of the completed
product needs to start. This assumes only a 6-week test cycle, which assumes
testing all along and rigorous testing by EC of the core. Even with these
assumptions, this is an aggressive final test schedule.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Tahoma">This should mark the end of software Beta testing
and the start of Service Pilot testing. This testing phase will focus on
making sure the interaction between users and support staff are robust
and tools for behavior management are fully adequate. Think of this as
Beta Testing the Community. If any charging mechanisms are to be in place,
this is when you turn them on. Your beta testers become paying customers,
and their behavior changes to reflect this.</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">This is also the date that prototypes of the product
need to go to magazines for review. This relates to their typical 2 month
lead time per issue and that the targeted November issues will be in subscriber's
hands in October to key them up for Christmas purchases. If the product
is not "done" by this time it could get a bad review that would kill its
sales. The major key date, however, is the E3 show.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">End May 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">The E3 show or Electronic Entertainment Expo is
THE trade show for the game industry now. Companies need to show near final
product here to the retail trade to get orders for the fall. If a product
appears "half baked" it will not get the retail commitment it needs and
consequently it will also not get the CUSTOMER X commitment it needs in
terms of marketing budget and such. This is also the date that the product
<I>will start</I> Beta test with all of its features implemented. Before
you can do that you need to Alpha test it.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">March 1<SUP>st</SUP> 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">Alpha testing of the product should begin on this
date. This would also be the absolute last date to drop in any missing
features into the product. This time is what gets you a solid reception
at E3. Ideally, you would want to deliver to CUSTOMER X a completed package
(complete with production tools) way before this date so they can come
up to speed.</FONT>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Tahoma">January 1<SUP>st</SUP> 1999</FONT></U>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">Ideally, we would be spending New Year's Day with
a hangover and a sense of accomplishment that we were finished with the
feature set of Cosm 1.0. If we do this, we will have ample test time and
we would be in a good position to handle the one feature that CUSTOMER
X is insisting on including that we have not even started yet (like commerce.)
This would also be the <I>latest</I> date that CUSTOMER X would need to
start its graphics and sound production for the product.</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Tahoma">Note: We would normally expect that content production
would start significantly earlier than January. August '98 would be more
realistic.</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Tahoma">I am sure that a good "software lawyer" would be
able to find devious ways to extend deadlines <I>from</I> the info simply
stated above. These dates are real and meeting them is something we must
make every effort to do.</FONT>

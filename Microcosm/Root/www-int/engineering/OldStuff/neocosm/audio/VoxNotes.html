Neocosm Voice-Chat Notes</H2>
A writeup of a meeting discussing VoxChat versus the OnLive-style audio
technology for use in Microcosm.
<BR>Randy, Christina, RobJ, JohnS, RobL, and Charlie Bedard were in attendance.
<BR>The meeting happened on May 21st (I think) and this writeup was done
May 29th by <A HREF="mailto:robj@communities.com">RobJ</A>.
<BR>These notes are disorganized!
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>RobL described a threading bug he had trouble with for quite some time,
where the codec failed to disconnect gracefully.&nbsp; Turned out this
was because the VoxWare library was multithreaded and ran at low priority.&nbsp;
When he sent it a shutdown signal from the app thread, the app was still
running much faster, so the app could clean up the VoxWare memory before
the VoxWare thread had gotten around to shutting down properly.&nbsp; Adding
a 1/2 second sleep to the app thread fixed this.

<P>DirectSound does not like VoxWare.&nbsp; They both want sole ownership
of the sound card.
<BR>DirectSound compatibility in general is a problem.&nbsp; OnLive had
2-voice codec problems with ACM and DirectSound (according to Charlie).
<BR>Theoretically DirectSound 5 helps with this, but OnLive doesn't know
since IS departments won't go for DX5.
<BR>Java 1.2 sound support <I>may</I> be DX5-based but we don't know.

<P>It turns out that the NetMeeting SDK has pretty much everything you
would need to do point-to-point call setup and audio handling.&nbsp; In
other words, it almost certainly makes sense to evaluate replacing the
VoxWare code (all of it) with the stock NetMeeting SDK.&nbsp; We don't
know what the redistribution issues are, but as far as Charlie knows, it
should be possible to make the NetMeeting SDK support direct point-to-point
audio streaming over IP.&nbsp; Technically the details aren't known either
though; RobL couldn't remember exactly what IP setup information the VoxWare
stuff needs to initiate connection, and H.323 is heinously complex in terms
of what data it defines for call setup.&nbsp; It would be ideal if there
were a NetMeeting wrapper that let you go "here's an IP address, here's
a port, go chat".&nbsp; But such a thing doesn't exist at the moment.

<P>VoxWare is dead; there is no support for it and it is obsolete code.

<P>VoxWare has some nice features like auto-silence detection and echo
suppression, but they're not worth the lack-of-support risk.

<P>We should probably market p2p audio as a "whisper" feature.&nbsp; Shared
audio is probably best done as a place--enter this room and find yourself
joining the conversation.&nbsp; Charlie said that the OnLive mixing stuff
(should we want to have EC rooms that use OnLive conferencing tech for
the shared audio) could do 30-40 conferences, each with 5-6 people, on
a loaded Pentium II 300.&nbsp; It scales from about 15 users on a P90 to
about 200 users on a P300.

<P>Neither OnLive nor any other H.323-ish approach yet has a story for
broadcast audio.

<P>1/2 duplex vs. full duplex depends on sound card &amp; drivers.&nbsp;
Icky issue.&nbsp; A "push to talk" button is the best fallback, and it's
lousy.

<P>If you're going to sell this to consumers, you need a <I>good</I> wizard
to help them get their mikes working.&nbsp; The NetMeeting wizard is awful
(as is all of NetMeeting, interfacewise).&nbsp; The VoxWare wizard we could
never get source for, so we didn't put it in the alpha.

<P>Those were the high bits that I rememer.

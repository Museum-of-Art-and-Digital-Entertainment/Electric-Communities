<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>The view we need to take is not of a Net-savy user, but of a neophyte
parent that has heard all the horror stories of the nasty people and places
on the net.&nbsp; They want to let their children experience it, but safely
and securely.

<P>Carmen San Diego is a natural property for Broderbund to want to exploit
on the Net.&nbsp; A whole series of products could be done based on "where
in the world..", "where in time...", "where in the numbers..", etc.&nbsp;
A potential hook for the product could be that, as example, the "where
in the world..." game would have a variety of different locations enabled
on individual CD's.&nbsp; That is, all CD's would contain all regions,
but CD A would have regions #1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 activated, and CD B would
have regions #6, 7, 8, and 9 activated, and so on.&nbsp; You would need
to link up with your friends who also bought the game to see more of the
available regions.&nbsp; This would need to be done under parental password
and guidance on a small scale "family and friends" micronet basis at first.&nbsp;
The trick here is to figure out how to allow Billy and his cousin Bobbie
to link for the first time.&nbsp; Then, as confidence is gained, more people
can be added to the circle.

<P>Each of these products will have to, first and foremost, be fun as a
stand-alone game.&nbsp; Regions would have their own activities based on
the main product theme.&nbsp; The networking aspects will be secondary
at first if at all as a reason to buy.&nbsp; When used, networking might
allow new activities or explorations to be accessed by the group.&nbsp;
Avatar and turf designing and customizing will be important as well.

<P>There is also a desire to pipe in a narrowcast of ads, merchandizing,
and messages from parent approved sources such as family.&nbsp; Perhaps
hints and tips to other Broderbund products like Riven can be sent also.

<P>Lastly, in time, there would be the desire to allow the kids to connect
to public servers with a parental password approval, certification that
the game was a purchased copy, and a credit card number for commerce all
given under secure communications.

<P>This is the basic concept, if in a rather terse presentation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Customer Tools.

<P>As a wise Engineer once said: "form follows function."&nbsp; This section
attempts to define the functions that will be required by customers of
Microcosm technology without getting into the methodology.

<P>The key to thinking like a Microcosm customer is that their desire will
be to promote their brand(s) to the world.&nbsp; This will be done through
the audio and visual elements in any Habitat they maintain.&nbsp; They
will want to update, add, expand and spotlight their properties.&nbsp;
It will be our job to allow them to easily and quickly do these tasks.&nbsp;
The tools are a means to an end.

<P>Some of these use functionality (such as commerce) which we will not
be delivering in 1.0; the point is to outline several scenarios as examples
of our early and/or eventual customers' needs, not to say "1.0 must do
all these".

<P>Here is a list of the tasks that will require tools, expressed in example
format.

<P>- Broderbund will want to create a Carmen San Diego Avatar.

<P>- Turner will want a Scooby Doo robot avatar as a narrator with canned
chat responses at a location in their realm.

<P>- South Park will want to play sound bites as an event triggered by
some user action.

<P>- Disney will want to add a jungle themed region to promote their new
theme park to their existing Disneyland / Disney World realm.&nbsp; This
will include new avatars, in-world objects, swatches and accessories that
will all be jungle themed.

<P>- Nike has a new line of shoes that they want to make into avatar clothing
accessories.

<P>- Mattel wants to give away a set of fashions for Barbie as a mid-summer
promotion to increase site traffic.

<P>- Eathan Allen furniture enters into a joint promotion with American
Girls Dolls to feature their funiture in turf catalogs.

<P>- Customer X wants to feature a Holloween costume party at their realm.&nbsp;
They want spooky background sounds, lots of costumes for guest avatars,
and a haunted house region motif.

<P>- MTV wants to have posters all over their realm that will take you
to various band sites and back.

<P>- MTV wants to host a chat session featuring look-alike avatars of U2
for the band to use.

<P>- Playboy wants to do some "custom" animations for their robot avatars.

<P>- M&amp;M Mars wants to "hide" a special object that looks like a bag
of all red M&amp;M's.&nbsp; The finder of it in the realm gets a prize.

<P>- Good Housekeeping only wants to allow objects with the "Good Housekeeping
seal of approval" into their realm.

<P>- K-Mart wants to announce (by voice) a blue light special in housewares
for 15 minutes only to all on line registered avatars.

<P>- Reebok wants to give you a cool avatar t-shirt if you buy a new pair
of shoes on their standard web site.&nbsp; Or maybe Foobucks (tokens).

<P>This will not be all the types of things folks will want to do, but
it will give you an idea of what the tools will need to do.&nbsp; I suspect
that they will be used by either marketing or creative services people
and not techies.

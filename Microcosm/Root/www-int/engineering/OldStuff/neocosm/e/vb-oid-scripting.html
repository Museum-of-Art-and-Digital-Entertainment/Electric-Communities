<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Original VB-based Scripting Proposal</H1>
<P>This is the original email message from Tony that started all this off. <A HREF="e-world-scripting.html">Here</A>
is my current best response on what these examples would look like in E for those in the C syntactic tradition,
and <A HREF="e-vb-oid-scripting.html">here</A> are the same examples expressed in E for those in the Visual Basic
syntactic tradition. The examples in this message and the E-based response are now cross-linked to each other
so you can easily see how the examples compare.</P>

From: Tony Grant &lt;tony@communities.com&gt;
Subject: E
</PRE>
<P>I've spoken briefly with most of you about E and my hopes that it will truly be just that. Mark has asked me
to provide a few samples of Visual Basic syntax. I've listed some sample scripts that I'd love to use. I'll state
briefly what the script should do and then provide some VB-like pseudo code to illustrate how simple I would like
things to be. [MarkM: This is not literal VB syntax, but enough to give you the flavor]</P>
<P>This also makes a couple of assumptions about E that I haven't heard anything completely final about: it can
be both a word scripting tool: Run Microcosm and do tests via a script mechanism</P>
<P>One question I have about the syntax is how much overhead is needed for any particular script. Crock and I briefly
discussed how neat it would be to have an E script for every unum which is not much more than a giant text field.
It would be great if the script could simply state the little bit of functionality and nothing else. In my mind,
this is what separates a script from a program. Users of the scripting language shouldn't have to deal with:</P>
<P>
<PRE>  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; or
  import EZ.Avatars.Speech
</PRE>
<P>or any other overhead junk.</P>
<P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
[<A NAME="cosm-api"></A><A HREF="e-world-scripting.html#cosm-api">See the E Version</A>]</P>
<P>Some of the neat behavioral stuff we can do depends on the events that we've defined. I know we'll at least
have timer events, RegionEntry, RegionExit, Bump ( walked into an object) , Click... I think we're also doing Speech
(triggered when anybody says something in a region. And maybe some others.</P>
<P>In VB, each of these would be a Method available to each object, and each Method would have a defined set of
parameters relevant to the event:</P>
<P>
<PRE>Click()
Bump()
RegionEntry(AvatarName as String)
RegionExit(AvatarName as String)
Speech(AvatarName as String, Text as String)
...
</PRE>
<P>Useful functions and data:</P>
<P>
<PRE>MyName
ListObjects()
ListAvatars()
ListPortals()
ListTeleportPads()
ListLocalRegions()
ListGestures()  [gestures known to this object]
PlayGesture(GestureName as String)
Say(Text as String)

Launch (AvatarName as String,RegionName as String)
WalkTo (RegionName as String)
TeleportTo (RegionName as String)
</PRE>
<P>Here are some script examples:</P>

the E for VB Version</A>]</P>
<P>1. Launch Microcosm with Yappy as the avatar and have him transition back and forth between CentralPark region
and BeachResort.</P>
<P>This would help us to find any memory leaks occurring on transitions. I don't know how much overhead would be
involved in this, but it would be great if it we're simple:</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Launch(&quot;Dax&quot;,&quot;CentralPark&quot;)

   For i = 1 to 100
      TeleportTo(&quot;BeachResort&quot;)
      TeleportTo(&quot;CentralPark&quot;)

<P>2. Visit every region in a realm. This would a great script to run after new art checking to make sure that
none of the new regions have broken the world.</P>
<P>
<PRE>   Launch(&quot;Dax&quot;,&quot;CentralPark&quot;)

   regions = ListLocalRegions
   For each r in regions
      TeleportTo (r)

   regions = ListLocalRegions

      TeleportTo regions(i)

<P>
<PRE>
   Launch(&quot;Dax&quot;,&quot;CentralPark&quot;)

   For i = 1 to 100

<P><IMG SRC="kilroy.gif" WIDTH="560" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
<P>This is my target. If things we're this easy, I'd be ecstatic. I don't particularly care about If...EndIf and
For...Next vs. braces, although scripting languages do seem to tend towards the former. It's arguably more <I>human</I>
readable (as opposed to more <I>programmer</I>-readable).</P>
<P>I'd like a user who's never programmed before to be able to select from a list of default script behaviors,
look at the text and understand what's going on. She could then change a text string and be thrilled to se the
behavior reflected in Microcosm. Feeling more ambitious, she cuts and pastes a few scripts together and starts
becoming comfortable with the syntax. Soon her turf is crawling with lively objects...</P>

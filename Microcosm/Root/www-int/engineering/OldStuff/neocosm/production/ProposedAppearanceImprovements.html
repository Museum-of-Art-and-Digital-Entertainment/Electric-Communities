<H2>Introduction</H2>
This document is meant to capture things we'd like to improve about our 
Appearance model.

<P>This will need some fleshing out, but I at least wanted to generate 
a list of things we've already talked about.

<H4>Gesture chaining</H4>
It would be really nice if all gestures had a field 
like playWhenDone in which we could specify another gesture that would
immediately follow.

<H4>Eventable gestures</H4>
Pick up a drink. Select sip from the drink's menu. 
It would be great if that could trigger a gesture on the avatar that puts
the drink up to the mouth. Another example would be sitting. Click 'Sit' on
a chair and the avatar walks there, turns appropriately, and then sits.

<H4>Play and hold</H4>
Often times, we'd like to play a gesture and have it remain in its
ending state. By default, our current model will always play a default gesture
(Stand, for example) after any other gesture completes.

<H4>Path planning</H4>
This is obviously more a dynamics engine thing than an
appearance thing, although objects will likely need to specify a bounding box or at
least a footprint in order for path planning to work.

<H4>Redundancy of sound support</H4>
We currently support VRML animation and texture animation for 3D objects. 2D
objects do cel animation. All types contain syntax for sound support. It would
be nice to abstract sound info into a form that could be referenced by all the 
other gesture types. One way to do this would be to make sounds their own gesture
type and then include on all gestures a field called 'playAlso' which would 
simultaneously trigger another gesture.

<H4>Better VRML support</H4>
But, then, you probably knew that already, didn't you. Our VRML parser bites.
This may not be the best place to track that, but it can't hurt to be worried
about something in more than one place. :-)

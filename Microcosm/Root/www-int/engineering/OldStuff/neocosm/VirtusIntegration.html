recommendation is to stick with AnyChannel-- a conclusion that was reached before
talks with Virtus began.

<H2>Overview</H2>
The Virtus renderer is a C++ based component architecture. It appears to be 
very fast, and quite complete. This document attempts to list potential snags in
migrating to this new renderer.

<HR>
<H3>If it aint broke...</H3>
A simple point here... we have a renderer that works. Integrating a new renderer means
changing lots of code. Clearly, there can be benefits from a new renderer: technical,
aesthetic, and strategic. The cost of work should not be underestimated, however.

<H3>C++ and Java</H3>
Their renderer is in C++. We're a Java house. We'll need to be extremely careful about
where we draw the boundary between our two codebases and how we integrate. Will our code 
"drive" their components through scripting (i.e. Sit on top of the Guard) or should we
write a networking component that drops into their container like everything else? One
abstraction I've heard mentioned is that their code represents everything from the Dynamics
Engine and below. I'm a little nervous about the messaging betwen all these objects going
from Component->Java->Comm->Java->Component and how this might impact responsiveness.
<P>
One potential solution to avoid the Java/C++ problem would be to write a Networking component
in C++. This should at least be considered as an option.

<H3>2 1/2D support</H3>
Our current renderer and dynamos support 2 1/2D art. 2D cutout sprites that scale and 
swap bitmaps depending on their orientation to the camera. We'd likely have to rewrite 
this into their component architecture.

<H3>Pixel perfect art, GUI plane</H3>
We also have support for "pixel perfect" art. This is art that can be described in
pixel coordinates rather than world coordinates. Our GUI plane which supports much of 
our UI (word balloons, watermarks, toolbars, pie menus) depends on this. We'd have to
be sure that Virtus can let us do all these things as we need to.

<H3>Snapshotting</H3>
We get a huge permance benefit from snapshotting. This is a method of converting objects
in a 3D scene that haven't changed in awhile into a 2D bitmap. It provides a huge 
performance gain for us. It's hard to know if such a solution would be possible in
Virtus' renderer, and if we'd want to do the work to support it.

<H3>3D acceleration in a window</H3>
It's been a hard product requirement of ours for a long time that we be able to run
inside a window, and not take over full screen. Part of this was that we needed/wanted
to integrate with a web broswer, and also because we have many support windows that
are meant to float separate from the main window.
<P>
Changing this requirement means changing *a lot* of UI.
<P>
Continuing to support this requirement raises the following issue:
<P>
To gain the benefits of the Virtus renderer, we need to be running on machines
with 3D hardware. There's a marketing issue about whether or not we can
reasonably expect to find 3D acceleartor boards on out target paltform machines.
Given our timeframe, that's probably acceptable. 
<P>
However, there's still a problem. There are still very few cards that can do
3D acceleration in a window. Virtus happens to demo using one of them, but I don't
believe that the average consumer PC with a bargain 3D card will have this support.
<P>
Here's some more info from Russ (copied from the Renderer Analysis page):
<P>
<I>
The AnyChannel renderer currently has 3D accelerator support in it for 3Dfx, ATI
and I think PowerVR.  The problem comes with wanting to run in a window.
Some of these cards flat out don't support running in a window (I think
it will be 2-3 years before the installed base of 3D cards that support
windowing outnumber the installed base of 3D cards that don't).  Even
ignoring that, 3D cards have hard memory constraints.  Running in
full-screen mode, regions would need to be designed with these
constraints in mind.  But wait, it gets worse!  If your user is running
their desktop at 1280x1024x16bit, they're chewing up 2MB of video RAM.
You'll need to allocate a front-buffer, back-buffer, and z-buffer for
uCosm, and then whatever scraps of memory are left can be used for
textures.  It really sucks that the application can know ahead of time
how much memory will actually be available (in fact, the user can even
change resolutions while the app is running).  Probably the best thing
to come along to help this pathetic situation is AGP.  AGP allows system
RAM to be used for textures (however, this RAM is like a disk buffer,
it's a fixed size that is allocated at boot time and cannot be used for
anything other than graphics).  This means that the front/back/z-buffers
can live on the card, what's left over on the card can be used for
textures, and then whatever memory has been set aside from the system
RAM can be used for extra textures.  It still won't be painless, but I
think it becomes possible.

<H3>Cartoon styles</H3>
This is another AnyChannel-specific feature we support. We haven't used it much,
but it's there, and we'd need to do some work to migrate this over to a new renderer.

<H3>Picking</H3>
From Alan:<P>
We've got some support for world coordinate picking in the renderer as well as the 
ability to return the 'tag' of a picked piece of geometry (which maps it to its 
Java object ID, which is how we figure out which object got picked).
<P>
We'll need comparable picking support.

<H3>Transparency & Translucency</H3>
We make heavy use of them. I'd be surprised if Virtus didn't support this, but presumptions 
are evil. Facts are good. We should make sure.

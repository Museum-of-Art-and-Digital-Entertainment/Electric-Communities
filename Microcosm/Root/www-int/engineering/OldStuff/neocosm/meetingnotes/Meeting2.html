<B><FONT SIZE=6><P>Meeting notes on </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=5>"</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Continue high level review of multipoint comm approach" </FONT><FONT SIZE=5>June 3, 1998. <B>Participants:</B> ScottL, Bill, Bob, Arturo</P>
<B><U><P>GENERAL:</P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P>PURPOSE: get Arturo's input on &nbsp;proposal yesterday and decide where to go from there</P>

<UL>
<LI>connection logistics between Connect me and Connect him</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>security: is there a gate keeper</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>VIEW is a router of group objects from the comm system</LI></UL>

</FONT><B><U><FONT SIZE=5><P>REQUIREMENTS:</P>

<UL>
</B></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><LI>VIEW API includes group and the level above it</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>how to break it up before it gets to the level of distributed objects</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>distributed topology and its interface to "group" (Bob's terminology, Arturo translates it to "session") is always the same regardless how things work underneath it</LI>
<LI>need to define who "group" is</LI></UL>

</FONT><B><U><FONT SIZE=5><P>ISSUES:</P>

<UL>
</B></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><LI>how unum spread and the interface on distributed object</LI>
<LI>group is a distributed object, but how is it shared at the level above it</LI>
<LI>what is the meaning of membership</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Does speaking to group have anything to do with being a member of the group?</LI>
<LI>Example:  When entering a region, what object to connect to? Is it object talking to object? Or is it a connection of processes? Then how to route processes? There is security hurdle on how to do that.</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Build multicast data comm on top of Point to Point?</LI>
<LI>Layer crossing model vs. Disjointed model</LI>
<LI>Bob's worry: sending data to presence vs. to host has nothing to do with "group"</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><U><FONT SIZE=5><P>CONCLUSION:</P>

<UL>
</B></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><LI>Bob will talk to RobJ about the Layer crossing model vs Disjointed Model</LI>
<LI>Arturo suggested that everyone work on their specific section of the diagram below. The "multicast on top of p2p" issue will be discussed again at a later time when they get closer to it in the development schedule.</LI></UL>

<h1>The Palace Directory (aka A-Z list) Specification</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h4>The Palace Directory</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This document describes the new A-Z List, which (I'm
    proposing) will be called <strong>&quot;The Palace
    Directory&quot;</strong> (TPD).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>TPD is the collection of pages and scripts that display
    lists of Palace Servers, sort of like our current A-Z list,
    but better. The main A-Z list replacement page is a compact,
    ordered-by-population, page which shows the name of the
    palace server, the number of users currently on the server, a
    short description of the Palace, and the URL for visiting the
    Palace. By using a compact presentation, spreading the
    listings over multiple pages, and limiting the number of
    entries on each page, we will improve the performance and
    navigational ability of the old A-Z list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Yellow Pages Daemon</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The information displayed on TPD pages is gathered by a
    server process run by EC called the Yellow Pages Daemon
    (YPD). The technical architecture of the new YPD server is at<a
    href="http://www-int/engineering/palace/ypd.html">
    http://www-int/engineering/palace/ypd.html</a>. (The YPD
    architecture document also briefly describes the existing YPD
    server and YPD protocol, which will be used by the new
    server.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Phased Approach</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This specification breaks features out into &quot;Phase
    1&quot; and &quot;Phase 2&quot;. Phase 1 features are to be
    implemented now. Phase 2 will follow after first release.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Current high-level architecture</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>The current A-Z list can be found at <a
    href="http://www.thepalace.com/welcome/sites/az.html">http://www.thepalace.com/welcome/sites/az.html</a>.
    This page is generated as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Every 20 minutes, Palace Servers send their Yellow
            Pages Directory (YPD) info over a direct TCP or UDP
            connection to the YPD server running on
            directory.thepalace.com. The YPD info includes:<ul>
                <li>palace name</li>
                <li>sysop</li>
                <li>server version id including machine type</li>
                <li>regcode</li>
                <li>url</li>
                <li>description</li>
                <li>announcement</li>
                <li>&quot;hide my entry&quot; flag</li>
                <li>&quot;I'm shutting down&quot; flag</li>
                <li>current number of users</li>
                <li>current number of rooms</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the number of users on a server changes (ie
            someone enters or leaves) then the palace server will
            send the YPD info at 5 minutes after the event
            occured. (The actual specifics of when updates are
            sent are a bit unclear. Nonetheless, palace servers
            send their updates frequently.)</p>
            <p>If the &quot;hide my entry&quot; flag is sent,
            then the palace server will not be displayed on the
            A-Z list web page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>This information is parsed by the YPD server and
            written to a flat file. The flat file contains one
            record for each palace server. When a palace server
            reports new information, the record for that palace
            server is updated. This update is done by matching
            the palace name and regcode with an entry in the flat
            file. See the new <a
            href="http://www-int/engineering/palace/ypd.html">Palace
            Yellow Pages Daemon (YPD)</a> architecture document
            for more details.<br>
            </li>
        <li>Every 5 minutes a script called
            /users/scrips/cgi-bin/directory.cgi runs on
            directory.thepalace.com to build the directory.html
            file from the YPD flat file. Both the
            alphabetically-ordered and population-ordered lists
            are constructed by the directory.cgi script.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Functional specification</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>This section describes the functional requirements of <strong>The
    Palace Directory</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>There will be seven basic pages where TPD information will
    be displayed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>&quot;Top 10&quot; </strong>list will be
            shown on the <a href="http://www.thepalace/com">http://www.thepalace/com</a>
            page</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Compact ordered-by-population&quot; </strong>-
            This page is displayed from the current <a
            href="http://www.thepalace.com/welcome/sites/az.html">http://www.thepalace.com/welcome/sites/az.html</a>
            URL. This page also displays the total number of
            palace servers reporting in, and the total number of
            users on all palace servers.</li>
        <li>A <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot; </strong>page
            will contain more information about a palace server.
            This page will be linked from the Palace Server's
            entry on the <strong>&quot;compact
            ordered-by-population&quot; </strong>list.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Find a Palace&quot;</strong> search
            form and results pages.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Edit Palace Server Entry&quot; </strong>will
            allow palace sysops to edit thier entries. (eg.
            specify the InstantPalace URL.)</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Palace Servers by Category&quot;</strong>
            list.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Palace Server usage statistics&quot;</strong>
            - part of the &quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot;
            page; only available to EC - requires a password.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The phased implementation of the above functionality is as
    follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The goal of phase 1 is to get a new, slightly better,
    version of YPD up and running. Phase 1 will provide the
    following features:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>&quot;Top 10&quot; </strong>list shown on the
            <a href="http://www.thepalace/com">http://www.thepalace/com</a>
            page.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;compact ordered-by-population&quot; </strong>list
            of palace servers. </li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot;</strong>
            linked from the Palace Server's entry on the <strong>&quot;compact
            ordered-by-population&quot; </strong>list.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The key feature in Phase 2 is palace server entry editing
    by server operators. The main purpose for this is to allow
    server operators to add their InstantPalace URL. The
    additions for Phase 2 are:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>&quot;Compact ordered-by-population&quot;</strong>:
            InstantPalace URLs will be available, if the entry
            has InstantPalace support.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot; </strong>will
            show InstantPalace URLs, if any for the entry. There
            will be a password protected link for EC staff to
            view <strong>&quot;Palace Server Usage
            Statistics&quot;</strong> for the palace server.</li>
        <li>A <strong>&quot;Find a Palace&quot; </strong>search
            form will be added to the top of all TPD pages.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Edit Palace Server Entry&quot; </strong>will
            allow palace sysops to edit thier entries. (eg.
            specify the InstantPalace URL.)</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Palace Servers by Category&quot; </strong>pages
            - Sysops will be able to classify their server in one
            or more categories.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;Palace Server Usage Statistics&quot;</strong>
            - This is an extension of the <strong>&quot;Detailed
            Palace Server&quot;</strong> page which shows usage
            statistics for the Palace Server. Its password
            protected and only visible to EC.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Functional descriptions</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>The following sections describe each page, list, or
    feature in detail, and which features are required for each
    phase:</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Top 10&quot; list functional description</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The <strong>&quot;Top 10&quot;</strong> list is on the
    main <a href="http://www.thepalace.com">http://www.thepalace.com</a>
    page. This is a very compact display of the top 10 palaces by
    population. Only two columns are in this list: Palace name
    and current population (number of users). This list also has
    a &quot;more...&quot; link that will take the user to the <strong>&quot;Compact
    Ordered-by-population list&quot;</strong>. Entries where the
    server operator has <u>not</u> checked the &quot;Show my
    server in the directory&quot; box, will be suppressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Probably none.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Compact Ordered-by-population&quot; list functional
description</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is the main list we want people to use to find
    palaces. Its optimized to present the largest number of
    palace servers with the least amount of clutter. The list is
    presented as a table with the following columns: Name of
    palace, number of users currently on, number of rooms in the
    palace, palace:// url, and the description of the palace. <em>(Issue:
    should we truncate the description? The initial plan called
    for truncating, however, displaying the complete description
    seems to work in the prototype.) </em>For each entry in the
    list, there will be an icon or link which take the user to
    the <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot; </strong>page<strong>
    </strong>for the Palace server. <em>(This link could be the
    palace name.) </em>The <strong>&quot;Compact
    Ordered-by-population&quot;</strong> list will be broken into
    pages containing 25 entries per page. There will be a link to
    go to the next 25 and previous 25 entries. In addition, there
    will be a way to navigate to any page from any other page
    within the <strong>&quot;Compact ordered-by-population&quot;</strong>
    set of pages. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Entries where the server operator has <u>not</u> checked
    the &quot;Show my server in the directory&quot; box, will be
    suppressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>At the top of each list, just above the column headings
    will be statement: &quot;There are X people chatting in Y
    Palaces.&quot; X is the number of of total users in all
    palace servers reporting in. Y is the number of palace
    servers reporting in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2: </u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In phase 2, the <strong>&quot;Edit Palace Server
    Entry&quot; </strong>will allow server sysops to add an
    InstantPalace URL to their listing. If a Palace directory
    entry has an InstantPalace URL, then a link will be shown for
    the InstantPalace URL on the Palace's entry in the <strong>&quot;Compact
    ordered-by-population&quot;</strong> set of pages. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot; page functional
description</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot; </strong>provides
    all the information about the palace that we want to present
    to the public: Name, URL, number of users on, number of
    rooms, description, announcement, and last-heard-from-time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In phase 2, the <strong>&quot;Edit Palace Server
    Entry&quot; </strong>will allow server sysops to add an
    InstantPalace URL to their listing. If a Palace directory
    entry has an InstantPalace URL, then TPD will show a link for
    the URL on the Palace's <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace
    Server&quot;</strong> page.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Find a Palace&quot; functional description</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>On the &quot;<strong>Compact Ordered-by-population</strong>&quot;
    pages there will be a simple form that allows the user to
    search for a palace. The search will be performed on any text
    in the palace server entry: Name, Description, Announcement,
    and URL. Palace server entries matching the search criteria
    will be displayed similar to the <strong>&quot;Detailed
    Palace Server Page&quot;</strong>, however multiple entries
    will be displayed on each html page. The number of palace
    servers per page will be limited; the exact number will be
    chosen through testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Entries where the server operator has <u>not</u> checked
    the &quot;Show my server in the directory&quot; box, will be
    suppressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Edit Palace Server Entry&quot; functional description</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<p>None.</p>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TBD. On the <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server
    Page&quot;</strong> there will be a &quot;Sysop Edit&quot;
    link. Selecting &quot;Sysop Edit&quot; will prompt the user
    for a password. If the correct password is entered for the
    palace entry, then a form with the editable fields will be
    presented. <em>(Exactly which fields are editable is TBD.)
    (Once this functionality is in place, EC will provide
    notification to the sysops via email, and a process will be
    in place for sysops to get their password. Authentication
    will be based on regcode.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 3:</u><em> (requires changes to palace server code.)</em></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The palace server's Palace Directory Form (e.g., under
    options on the win32 pserver) will be removed. When a sysop
    installs a server, the server will launch the sysop to the <strong>&quot;Edit
    Palace Server Entry&quot;</strong> web based form. <em>(Authorization
    is still TBD; We'll probably require the pserver's regcode
    for validation.) </em>In this model, a new YPD protocol will
    be implemented which just sends current user and room counts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Palace Category&quot; pages functional description</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1.</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2.</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TBD. We will maintain a list of categories. EC staff will
    be able to specify one or more categories for palace servers.
    Palace server sysops will be able to specify categories for
    their server using the <strong>&quot;Edit Palace Server
    Entry&quot; </strong>page. <em>(The categories page format
    needs to be spec'ed.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Palace Server Usage Statistics&quot; functional
description</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1: </u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>No presentation requirements. <em>(Note: Ypd should record
    usage statistics as soon as possible, so historical data is
    present before the presentation is in place.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>YPD will record the number of peak number of users over
    time for each palace server. This information will be
    maintained only for a short amount of time, ideally 24 hours.
    In addition, daily totals will be maintained for 6 months.
    With this information we will be able to identify the peak
    periods of the day or week for each palace. The <strong>&quot;Palace
    Server Usage Statistics&quot; </strong>will be presented on
    the <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server&quot; </strong>page.
    This information will only be visible to EC staff; a password
    will be required. <em>(This is a future feature which
    requires more spec. We could have another set of pages for EC
    staff that are password protected, or we could use a
    hard-to-guess URL, or a URL with a &quot;password&quot;
    argument. Other suggestions?)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Technical Specification Overview</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>This section briefly describes how the pages listed above
    will be generated. <em>(This section actually belongs in a
    seperate document. Its here for convience.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>The new Palace Directory architecture utilizes a
    multithreaded YPD server running on Solaris to receive and
    process the YPD updates from the palace servers. The YPD
    server parses the YPD update message, verifies the regcode,
    and writes the fields to an Oracle RDMS database. Refer to <a
    href="http://www-int/engineering/palace/ypd.html">Palace
    Yellow Pages Daemon (YPD)</a> for more information. Scripts
    are run on the web server machine to generate the html
    content from data stored in the database. &quot;Mostly&quot;
    static data (eg the &quot;top 10&quot; list) is generated by
    a script which is run periodically. Content which is
    maintained in the database and infrequently required is
    retrieved by scripts on demand, usually by the user. For
    example, the display of the &quot;detailed palace server
    page&quot; is performed by a script on demand when the
    &quot;detail&quot; URL for that palace server is selected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>The following sections describe the technical details of
    each feature by phase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Top 10 list&quot; technical details</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The html for the Top 10 List is generated periodically by
    a perl script which queries the database. This query will be
    performed such that entries with the
    &quot;hide-my-entry&quot; flag will be suppressed. Since this
    list needs to be in-sync with the Compact
    ordered-by-population (which is also generated by a script),
    we will run the two scripts at the same interval. Its
    possible that we can optmize performance by implementing the
    functionality for the creation of the two lists within a
    single script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TBD.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Compact Ordered-by-population list&quot; technical
details</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The html for this list is also generated by a script thats
    run periodically. The current plan is to set the interval at
    5 minutes. This script will query the database for the
    columns corresponding to the fields displayed in the table.
    The results of the query will be written to successive files
    such that each file is small enough for quick download. Each
    file will contain HREF links to the preceeding and following
    files. In addition, HREF links will be included in each page
    to allow for navigation to any ordered-by-population page.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Each entry on the <strong>&quot;Compact
    Ordered-by-population list&quot; </strong>will have an HREF
    for that entry's <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server
    Page&quot;</strong>. The URL for this HREF will point to a
    script which takes as a parameter the unique database id for
    the entry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2: </u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TBD.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Detailed Palace Server Page&quot; technical details</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This page will be generated by a script. The script takes
    as a parameter the unique database id for the entry. The
    script does a database query based on the unique database id
    and formats the results to HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The <strong>&quot;Detailed Palace Server Page&quot; </strong>script
    will create HTML for the additional sysop editable fields
    such as the InstantPalace URL.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Find a Palace&quot; technical details</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is still somewhat TBD, but the current plan is to do
    a database query to retrieve palace server names,
    descriptions, and announcement fields. The &quot;where&quot;
    clause of the query will contain the search text. The query
    will use a cursor to limit the number of rows returned, with
    ability to fetch the next N rows, or previous N rows. Each N
    rows will be displayed. The next (or previous) N rows will be
    fetched from the cursor when the user navigates forward or
    backwards in the search result pages. This method will
    improve end user perception of performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Edit Palace Server Entry&quot; technical details</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TBD.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Palace Servers By Category&quot;</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2:</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TBD. This is probably a set of static pages generated by a
    script which is run as needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>&quot;Palace Server usage statistics&quot; technical details</h4>

<p><u>Phase 1.</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><u>Phase 2.</u></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>TBD. YPD will store in the database user counts by hour
    per palace server. These will be maintained for a short
    duration, probably 24 hours, though the exact duration needs
    to be evaluated. Daily, usage stats will be rolled into
    another table that maintains daily usage peaks. When the
    usage stats are requested, a script will run to format the
    daily usage or hourly stats into a graph.</p>

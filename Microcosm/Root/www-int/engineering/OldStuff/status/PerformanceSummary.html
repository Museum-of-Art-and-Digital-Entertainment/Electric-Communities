Performance Summary</H1></CENTER>
Engineering has set performance targets for ourselves. Our goal is to reach
these targets <I>and see room for improvement</I> by January 7, 1998. All
measurements are on a Pentium 166 machine with 32 megs of RAM. Transitions
must be done over a 28.8 modem.

<P><B>Updated 12/16/97</B>

<P>&nbsp;
<H2>
RAM</H2>
<B>Problem: </B>Our application needs to run in 32 megs by January 7, and
needs to support many people on a hub without thrashing severely.&nbsp;
We have succeeded in getting nine people into a hub (on Friday 12/12) without
thrashing; we are running further scaling tests and 32M-machine tests this
week.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Approaches: </B>See the hotlist.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Prognosis: </B>We have developed RAM profiling tools that give
us almost complete visibility into our heap and its VM layout.&nbsp; These
have already proved helpful in finding significant RAM consumptions (scene,
renderer, and native threads) that have since been optimized.&nbsp; We
look forward to these tools earning their keep.&nbsp; It is still too early
to tell whether we have a viable product on a 32M machine; tests this week
will give us that data.

<P>&nbsp;
<H2>
Startup</H2>
<B>Problem: </B>Most products start up in about 5 to 15 seconds (some even
less), and ours needs to do the same. For the 1/7/98 date, we're setting
a target of 30 seconds. Currently, the application is taking 90 seconds
with the JIT.

<P><B>Approaches:&nbsp; </B>1) Speed up class loading in our current environment
(ScottL).&nbsp; 2) Compile all of Microcosm to a native .exe file (Jay,
Dima, Wayne).&nbsp; 3) Speed up startup in general (Claire, Mike).

<P><B>Prognosis:</B> The biggest thing standing in our way is the inability
of all the Java environments we have yet looked at to load a couple thousand
classes in a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; It's not that our application
is unduly big (plenty of other apps our size load much more quickly); it's
that we're using Java environments that have not been optimized for delivering
or launching big systems.&nbsp; Some Java environments are moving in the
direction of supporting larger Java systems; we are aggressively working
to bring Microcosm into those environments, and we expect either positive
results (in which case we win) or negative results.&nbsp; If none of the
currently shipping Java build environments are able to compile Microcosm
into some faster-loading form, we may be stuck with slow load times until
such environments appear... i.e. we will then be at the mercy of the Java
tools marketplace.&nbsp; HOWEVER, Supercede and Cafe are both looking promising
as solutions to this problem.

<P>&nbsp;
<H2>
Transitions</H2>
<B>Problem: </B>Users move from region to region on a regular basis, and
it needs to feel snappy. We're hoping for 1-3 second transitions for the
product, but we'll be satisfied with 10-second transitions for January
7, again assuming we see room for improvement. Currently, transitions are
taking 13 seconds in stand-alone mode with the JIT. When a user is connected
to another machine, transitions take 33 with the JIT.&nbsp; These measurements
are prior to the presence spread code's checkin.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Approaches: </B>The presence spread code changes this behavior.&nbsp;
We have also had some runs where host/client transitions were quite speedy;
however, initial entry into a hub is still too slow, and needs extensive
profiling this week.&nbsp; Also, modems have not been sufficiently tested.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rob has eliminated over half the round trips in initial world entry/teleporting
to a new region; this will definitely have an impact but has not been measured
yet.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Prognosis:</B> Once logged into a hub on a LAN, transitions
are already performing adequately; but initial entry and over-a-modem transitions
are still in need of work.

<P>&nbsp;
<H2>
Scaling</H2>
<B>Problem: </B>Our hub product needs to support 50 users on one machine,
though we expect to limit regions to about 6-10 avatars at any given time.
For January 7, we need to be able to have 7 avatars in a region at the
same time with ease. Ideally, we should be able to have 20 users on the
same machine at the same time.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Approaches:</B> Kill the swap sucker!!!!!&nbsp; Much progress
has been made on this front and we have succeeded at getting 9 into a region
on Friday 12/12 followed by 17 people on 12/19 and hopefully 30 this week.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Prognosis:</B> Looks like we may be doing well on this one.

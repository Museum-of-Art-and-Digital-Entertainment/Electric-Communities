</UL>

<H3>Reference Architecture</H3>

<P>This reference architecture is designed to be easy to understand and
reason about. In <B><I>section-xxxx</I></B> we discuss ways to improve
the performance of the reference architecture. The reference architecture
is based on the E runtime libary and point-to-point comm system. Note that
all return values are returned thru the Promise mechanism.</P>

<P><TT>MSG.Register</TT> - A <TT>ClientControl </TT>object is created,
and a sturdyRef for that object is returned to the client. The <TT>ClientControl
</TT>object allows the client to create new <TT>ClientInformation </TT>objects.
Each kind of information whose distribution needs to be separately controlled
needs a separate <TT>ClientInformation </TT>object. The <TT>ClientInformation
</TT>object allows the client to get a <TT>ClientInformationChange </TT>noticer
object. The <TT>ClientInformation </TT>object implements the <TT>MSG.Location</TT>
message. <TT>ClientInformationChange </TT>implements the <TT>MSG.Here</TT>
message.</P>

<P><TT>MSG.Here</TT> - This message acts to inform the target <TT>ClientInformationChange
</TT>object that a ComCom client wants to be informed of a change in the
information. The <TT>MSG.Here</TT> message includes the version of the
information that the ComCom client knows. The first message sent by a ComCom
client uses version number 0. When the current version of the <TT>ClientInformation
</TT>is greater than the version requested, the <TT>ClientInformationChange
</TT>object sends to the response object with the current version number
and the current information. If the version number sent is the same as
the current version, the response object goes on a list of pending responses.
If the information changes, the version number is incremented, and all
the response objects are notified of the new version and value.</P>

<P><TT>MSG.Location</TT> - This message informs the target <TT>ClientInformation
</TT>object about a change in the information it is distributing. It increments
the version number of the information and notifies the pending response
objects.</P>

<P><TT>MSG.Logout</TT> - This messages causes the <TT>ClientInformation
</TT>object to change the information to &quot;offline&quot; and notify
the waiting response objects. <TT>MSG.Here</TT> requests with the version
number of the &quot;offline&quot; information will remain pending until
the next time the ComCom client sends a <TT>MSG.Location</TT> message.</P>

<H4>Objects and Messages</H4>

<LI>ClientInformation getNewClientInformation(); // Returns a new ClientInformation
object - uses Promise</LI>

<H3>Performance Optimizations</H3>

<P>There are three heavy-weight pieces to the reference protocol, TCP,
permanent objects, and public key encryption. We use TCP for reliable,
in-order messaging, and public key encryption for privacy and authentication.
We need privacy to protect the representation of capabilities on the wire.
We need authentication to protect against various hijacking and spoofing
attacks.</P>

<H4>Representation of Capabilities</H4>

<P>The E protocol represents a capability as the combnation of a vatID
and a Swiss Number. Each of these is a 20 byte number. Anyone who knows
these numbers holds the capability. As such they must be encrypted in transmission
to protect them from being stolen. In the reference protocol description,
each message includes the capability being invoked, so each message needs
to be protected.</P>

<P>Since there is only one legitmate holder of the ClientInformation object,
we can short-cut the representation of that capability if we authenticate
the message. This allows us to avoid having to encrypt the MSG.Location
and MSG.Logoff messages. See <A HREF="#Optimized Messages">Optimized Messages</A>
for details.</P>

<P>Since the transfer of ClientInformationChange capabilities is relatively
rare, we can steal an idea from the E point to point protocol. If the holder
of one of these capabilities must register it (using a heavy weight protocol)
with the ComCom server before it is used, and we authenticate the MSG.Here
message, we can replace the capability with a &quot;registered objects&quot;
table index in that message.  See <A HREF="#Optimized Messages">Optimized
Messages</A> for details.</P>

<P>These capability representation transformations place an additional
burden on the server. It must, for each ComCom user, maintain the values
of that user's ClientInformation object table and ClientInformationChange
table. There must be a protocol for when the client and server get out
of sync about the contents of this table. This data must persist over server
restarts, or there will be a heavy reregistration load after a restart.
The resyncing logic may allow the server to discard infrequently used tables.</P>

<H4>Using UDP to replace TCP</H4>

<P>TCP provides four services that UDP does not: </P>

<UL>
<LI>flow control</LI>

<LI>elimination of duplicate messages</LI>

<LI>in-order delivery</LI>

<LI>reliable delivery</LI>
</UL>

<P>If a particular message needs only a few of these services, it may be
cheaper to build them in to the application.</P>

<H4>Message Services needed by ComCom</H4>

<P>ComCom's need for each of the TCP services plus privacy and authentication
is message dependent.</P>

<P>(capa) means that the representation of capabilities needs to be protected.
No other data needs to be protected.</P>

<P>(1) MSG.Here does not need protection against duplicate messages because
each change to the data has a serial number. The ComCom server can just
respond to each duplicate message using its normal protocol. The ComCom
client must use the serial number to detect and discard duplicate responses
from the server to eliminate packet storms.</P>

<P>(2) MSG.Here does not need in-order delivery because there will be at
most one outstanding message between a client and the server at a time.</P>

<P>(3) Reliable delivery for the MSG.Here message can be acheived by changing
the server logic to always immediatly respond to a MSG.Here message. This
response is either the normal, &quot;here is the new value of the data&quot;
message, or it is a &quot;I got your message &lt;serial number&quot; message.
Upon receipt of this second message, the client knows that the server has
received the request.  The server should re-send its delayed response if
it does not receive a new MSG.Here message from the client to protect against
their loss.</P>

<P>Every UDP implementation is required to accept packets up to 576 bytes.
If we can keep our message size below this, we are assured that our protocols
will be portable.</P>

<H4><A NAME="MAC Authentication"></A>Using symmetric authentication to
replace public key operations</H4>

<P>If the two ends of the connection have a shared secret, they can use
it to authenticate messages with a HMAC. If we compute a SHA1 hash of (key,
pad, message, key) each machine which shares the secret can validate that
the message came from one of the machines that share the secret. (The pad
extends the key to the size of a hash block, 64 bytes for SHA1 or MD5.)
What we lose is the knowledge of which of the sharing machines generated
the message.</P>

<P>As a matter of cryptographic hygiene, we should have a way of changing
this key periodically. I (wsf) think for ComCom like data, once a year
would be enough.</P>

<P>When the client registers with the MSG.Register message, the ComCom
server and the client can agree on a shared secret. This secret should
be on the order of 12-20 bytes. The MSG.Register message can either be
carried by a secure E connection, in which case the client can generate
the key and sent it to the host, or the registration can occur with an
insecure connection and the key can be generated using a signed Diffie
Hellmann exchange. (See ec.elib.net.data.StartUpProtocol, methods firstDH()
and isSecondDKOK() for key generation; and ec.elib.net.data.SendThread,
method computeMAC() for HMAC calculation.)</P>

<H3><A NAME="ComCom client"></A>ComCom “People &amp; Places” client <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;required
for most strategies&gt;&gt;</FONT></H3>

<P>This is an important evolution of “Buddy List” applications. Besides
the usual instant messaging, chat, and group management, ComCom adds important
identity security features (by being closely linked with ECID). It also
adds new “Favorite Places List” functions: Not only can you see your friends,
you can see where they are (what web pages, what virtual worlds, etc.)
Users can also monitor traffic at favorite locations (web pages, worlds,
rooms) and click-to-connect to those communities.&nbsp; This would be new
work, all done by EC, but would NOT have the security requirements that
ECID does, so can be developed using tools other than Java. See <A HREF="SampleScreens.html">sample
screens</A>. </P>

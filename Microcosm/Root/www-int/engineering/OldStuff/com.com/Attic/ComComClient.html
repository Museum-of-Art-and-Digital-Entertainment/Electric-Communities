<A NAME="introduction"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>
The ComCom Client is designed to add value to the traditional
'buddy list' concept pioneered by ICQ by also tracking 'locations.'
The location information can be anything related to a persons presence on
the net -- the simple fact that they are 'online' and connected,
the URL(s) they are currently browsing, or the current Palace server they
are connected to.
<P>The ComCom Client provides a rich, yet easy to use, interface to these
disparate types of information. It presents the concept of location in a
form that allows a much richer experience than merely knowing that your
friends are connected -- now you can find out where they are as well.

<A NAME="requirements"><H2>Requirements</H2></A>
The ComCom Client needs to be able to display varied location information about
other ECID users, as well as aggregated information about the various locations
themselves (<I>e.g.</I> 'There are 15 people currently connected to the South Park
Palace', where the count is the number of ECID users currently connected).
<P>In addition to displaying location information, the ComCom Client will also provide
a full-fledged user interface for the ECID core module. Through the ComCom Client, the user
will be able to change profile information, set up demographic data, and gain fine-grained
control over the various services provided by the ComCom client and the ECID module.
<A NAME="architecture"><H2>Architecture</H2></A>
The ComCom Client will be written in C++ using the appropriate application framework
for each platform (<I>i.e.</I> MFC for Windows, <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com">Metrowerks</A>
PowerPlant for Macintosh, and perhaps <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com">Metrowerks</A> Latitude for X-Windows).
As much of the core functionality dealing with processing messages from the server and
interfacing with the ECID module will be generic (<I>i.e.</I> cross-platform support will
be an key criteria in design decisions) while allowing each user interface paradigm to
be as natural as possible for each platform.

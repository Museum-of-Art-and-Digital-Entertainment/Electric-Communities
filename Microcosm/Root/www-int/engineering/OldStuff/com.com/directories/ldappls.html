<h1>LDAP Process Location Server</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes how we will use an LDAP server
for the purpose of implementing a Process Location Server.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<li>Ability for ecid to register and update the mapping between
the ecid's vatid and a location expressed by an IP address and port.</li>

<li>The vatid will be authenticated.  Others should be prevented
from changing the registered location of another's vatid.</li>

<li>vatids can not be wildcard searched for.  The client 
doing a lookup must fully specify the vatid, and only one
vatid/location pair should be returned per lookup.</li>

<li>Ability to handle 0.2 registrations per second.  (See the 
<a href="../PalaceECIDTest.html">Palace-ECID Test Plan</a> for
more details on how this number was arrived at.)</li>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>There are two operations that a PLS must implement:</p>

<li>Registering a vatid with a specific IP address and port combination, and</li>
<li>Looking up an IP address/port by vatid.</li>

<h3>Registering a vatid</h3>
<p>Registrations are done via a <u>LDAP Registration Server</u>.
This server exports a "register" method available via RMI.  The EC
comm system is used beneath RMI to support the authenticating
of the vatid used on the connection.  This will ensure that
the vatid being registered is indeed the vatid of the remote
end that initiated the connection.

<h3>Vatid Lookups</h3>
<li>Vatid lookups are performed using the LDAP.  We are currently
using the Netscape Java LDAP API, which is documented in the 
<a href=http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/dirsdk/jsdk30/index.htm>
Netscape Directory SDK 3.0 for Java Programmer's Guide</a>.

<p>The following diagram shows the overall architecture, and the
usage of registration and lookup.</p>

<h4>Off the shelf alternatives</h4>

<p>Most of this is off-the-shelf.  To attain full off-the-shelf-ness
we would need to utilize LDAP authentication mechanisms for the
registration process. Utilizing our comm system is a much cleaner
alternative.</p>

<h4>Other Design Objectives, Constraints and Assumptions</h4>

<p><em>TBD.</em></p>

<h4>Implementation overview</h4>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>TBD. Performance should take into account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Performance of LDAP servers: How well does it scale?, How
        many servers do we need?, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Testing Strategy and Debugging</h4>

<p>TBD. Testing will include load testing of the server using
load test drivers.</p>

<h4>Interactions and dependencies with other subsystems</h4>

<p><i>TBD.</i>&nbsp; </p>

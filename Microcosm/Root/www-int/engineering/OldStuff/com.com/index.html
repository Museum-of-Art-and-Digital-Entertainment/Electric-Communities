<P><B>Right now…</B>

<P>Current Microcosm features are designed to support "branded micronets."
We’ve been seeking entertainment-industry partners with graphical brands
to build CD-ROM products based entirely upon Microcosm technology and tools.
Partners value Microcosm because it gets kids on the Internet safely through
private networks and protects brands from hacking and misuse. We are re-engineering
Microcosm Release 167 to modularize code and improve performance. The schedule
aims to ship products for the Christmas 1999 sales cycle.

<P><B>Motives for a change of strategy…</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Microcosm Alpha problems –</I> With R167 features, it is hard to find
people across Microcosm places, join them and know what places are worth
visiting at any time.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Similar Palace problems</I> – Similar problems led to the prototype
of Little Buddy.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Delayed Revenues</I> – The long Microcosm development cycle means no
revenues until Christmas 1999.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Buried intellectual assets – </I>EC has buried its key assets into a
graphical world application desired by only a fraction of Internet users
(the re-engineering allows us to break it out now). We can liberate these
assets for better use in Microcosm, as well as for a larger and more general
play.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Secure, distributed identity problem – </I>Microcosm has been built
on EC’s distributed, secure identity model. If someone else owns the secure
global identity space (and with the press about ICQ, people are racing
to get it), then Microcosm’s foundation becomes idiosyncratic and non-standard.
We must grab the secure identity play now.</LI>

<LI>
<I>ICQ –</I> The ICQ sale indicates that aggregating population has value
– even without revenues – even without security.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Fears of the Internet – </I>Potential Microcosm partners are looking
for less risky ways to approach Internet products and want more value.</LI>
</UL>
<B>The change…</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Break out the <U>EC</U> <U>Id</U>entity module (ECID). The ECID module
creates a sturdy reference and process, hands out capabilities for each
ECID and keeps a list of who has been given those capabilities. ECIDs are
persistent, secure, unique and addressable. With secure communications,
other features and applications can be associative and optional.</LI>

<LI>
Create an application (internal name ComCom) that is a "low cost, always
up" tool to help users coordinate activities between multiple people, groups
and places on the net in a secure fashion. This gives end-users and companies
the ability to keep in touch with each other.</LI>

<LI>
Create other features and applications on top of ECID and ComCom that help
aggregate population and glean revenues (DynaChat, MetaThread, Microcosm,
LobbyCosm, Palace).</LI>

<LI>
Continue to re-engineer Microcosm for modularity. Build developer and end-user
tools for platform customization and extension.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Market viability…</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>ECID</I> – EC publishes code to allow any application to talk to the
ECID module. We offer persistent, secure identity to application builders
and hardware manufacturers. This simplifies authentication for them. It
aggregates population for us. Since ECID also manages client-side certificates,
EC becomes a defacto distributor of certificates, promoting more ComCom
downloads. ECID can be added to any existing application to provide secure,
distributed identities, also aggregating population for EC.</LI>

<LI>
<I>ComCom</I> – EC approaches companies to bundle ComCom and ECID on their
applications. In addition to above value, this gives them an addressable
population even when users are in other applications. This provides incentive
for company to promote installation. It aggregates population for EC. We
use ComCom to promote Palace and Microcosm. Place windows can be saved
for advertising sales.</LI>

<LI>
<I>The Palace</I> – EC bundles The Palace with ECID and ComCom. In addition
to above values, this provides graphical contexts for customer and technical
support, promotes ECID and ComCom installation, distributes Palace clients,
provides opportunity for Pserver and PubServer sales and aggregates population
for ECID, ComCom and The Palace.</LI>

<LI>
<I>DynaChat and MetaThread</I> – EC creates and hosts simple and limited
free chat and bulletin boards for ComCom users over any "place" on the
Internet, especially WWW pages. EC builds a series of tools that add value
to these chat sessions (tools to collect the ECIDs of chatters, add advertising,
gain wizard features). E.g., EC approaches WWW developers, ISPs and site
owners with free chat, plus toolkits for a limited time, in return for
putting the ComCom button on the WWW page. When ComCom population reaches
critical mass, chat hosting and tools can be sold.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Lobbycosm</I> – EC licenses the ‘Cosm code to partners who ship on CD-ROM,
want to play safely in the Internet and multi-user space, and want to aggregate
their populations. Perhaps these partners are too far into development
cycles to switch to a new platform, or don’t want to jump in with both
feet. They put Microcosm side-by-side with their current applications and
through art, hot spots, and limited programming, add multi-user functions
on the front-end and population aggregation on the back-end. With EC’s
secure communications, partners know that they can continually and seamlessly
add new multi-user richness to this population, eventually moving to the
full platform</LI>

<LI>
<I>Microcosm</I> – We can license the Microcosm software as basis for new
products. But with ComCom and ECID, we can sell distributed, multi-user
solutions <B><I>slowly</I></B> to companies: (1) They can start using ECID
on their WWW pages and applications with no cost to aggregate their populations
and handle their authentication needs in a single solution. (2) They can
use ComCom to communicate with their populations over time and space. (3)
They can use Lobbycosm as a low-risk, low-cost way to enter the Internet
and multi-user space: (a) it doesn’t require a commitment to a new code
base; (b) it provides micronets that only let kids play with known kids
(c) micronets don’t require server hosting or community management investments
by the company (d) with our secure communications, they can seamlessly
add to Lobbycosm, moving more and more onto our platform. (4) They can
increment their way to Microcosm and have the foundations of a large population
with secure IDs and good communication channels available when they want
to deploy more fully. When they want to add public servers, they can use
our crowd mechanism, combined with the certificates on ECIDs, to allow
kids to join crowds/events and only interact fully with their micronet
friends.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Synergies…</B>
<UL>
<LI>
EC has multiple ways to aggregate population with secure, persistent, unique,
addressable IDs. ECIDs are the basis for large, general plays.</LI>

<LI>
Supports both the Microcosm and Palace plays and adds value to customers
by allowing them to aggregate and manage their own populations with the
ECID/ComCom back-end.</LI>

<LI>
ComCom adds core features to existing buddy lists that no competitor has,
including place, groups and secure identity.</LI>

<LI>
It is a one-two-punch because EC’s platform feeds our population aggregation
strategy and ComCom feeds our platform play.</LI>

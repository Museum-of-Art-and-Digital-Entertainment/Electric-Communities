<p>
If you need to build a release to distribute to other people this is
how to do it. Building a release is pretty simple (thanks to lots of
work by Eric and Felix) but it is time consuming, because care is
taken to ensure that everything is rebuilt from scratch. Before
building a release you should make sure you already have a working
build (e.g. by following the steps in <A href="BuildAll.html">Building
the entire EC world</a>). If you are trying to merge changes or add
new features, use normal builds to work out the bugs and then build a
release when you're sure things work.
<p>
You must have Microsoft Developer Studio installed and you must have checked
out EC, media and src before you start.
<p>

<h3>Step 1 - Start Shell</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To do
<dd>Start up a 4dos (Release) shell, using the shortcut in your Programs
menu.
<dt>Background
<dd>This starts up a 4dos shell with a minimal <code>PATH</code> and
<code>CLASSPATH</code>, which will ensure that you don't pick up any
prebuilt classes or binaries.
</dl>

<h3>Step 2 - Build The Release In A Minimal Environment</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To do <dd><code>cd \src</code> and type <code>bash config.build
release.config make full-release</code> or (possibly) <code>bash
config.build myconfigfile make full-release</code>.  <dt>Background
<dd>This is the cool bit. It builds all the sources, sets up a release
directory, zips up all the classes into the release directory and
finally builds and installs the repository, all in a single step. This
takes a while, well over two hours on some machines.
<p>
<code>config.build</code> is a shell script which takes a
configuration file and a command as arguments. It sets up the
environment according to the configuration file and then runs the
command in that environment (in our case the command we run is
<code>make</code>, with the <code>full-release</code> target as its
argument).
<p>
For many people the standard configuration file, <code>release.config</code>,
will be fine. But you should look at it and make sure it corresponds to
the setup on your machine. If it doesn't, make a copy, say
<code>myconfigfile</code>, edit it, and then give your edited config file
as the first argument to <code>config.build</code>.
<p>
When this step completes (assuming it succeeds) there will be a
complete release in <code>\Build\Release</code>, including zipped up
class files, DLLs, repository, supporting software, supporting files etc.
</dl>

<h3>Step 3 - Set Up The Registry</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To Do
<dd> <code>cd \Build\Release\bin</code> and type <code>.\regupdate</code>.
<dt>Background
<dd>This updates the registry so that clicking on <code>mcmav</code> and
<code>mcm</code> files (or selecting "Account Manager" from your Windows
Start Menu) starts up the AccountManager, from which you can start HabiFoo.
</dl>


<h3>Step 4 - Running HabiFoo</h3>
<dl>
<dt>To Do
<dd>You can now select "Account Manager" from the Windows Start Menu or double
click on an <code>mcm</code> file (if you have any) to start
HabiFoo. See
<A href="RunHabiFoo.html#AccountManager">Running the HabiFoo application</a>
for more details.
</dl>


<h2>Further builds</h2>

If you get errors during the build you may want to make changes to
source and rebuild. To do this you should <em>not</em> do a <code>make
full-release</code> again; the first thing <code>full-release</code>
does is delete your <code>\Build</code> tree, forcing a build from
scratch. You can, however, go to <code>\src</code> and then type
<code>bash config.build <em>configfile</em> bash</code>. This leaves
you in a bash shell with the environment set correctly. Using this
shell, you can then repeat the parts of the build that failed or
weren't started.  <code>full-release</code> does the following:
<code>tag-start clean-build everything release zipclasses makerep
tag-end</code>.  You don't need to do the <code>tag-start</code>,
<code>clean-build</code> or <code>tag-end</code> targets. But you can
repeat the other ones.  And, for small changes, you can also go to the
appropriate part of the source tree and rebuild locally, using just
<code>make</code>.
<p>
As always, there are some gotchas to watch out for. See
<A href="IncBuild.html">Incremental Builds</a> for more details.


<h2>Building an FP Release</h2>

If, instead of <code>full-release</code>, you use the
<code>fp-release</code> target, the build will package up all the
First Party software (E, Pluribus, HabiFoo etc.) into
<code>\Build\FP</code>, in addition to building a full release.
<code>\Build\FP</code> can then be copied into <code>\EC\FP</code> and
checked in as part of the build environment. Normally only Felix uses
the <code>fp-release</code> target, in order to keep
<code>\EC\FP</code> up to date. If you do decide to use it be warned
that it is <em>not</em> suitable for incremental development. The
stage which packages up the classes and libraries into
<code>\Build\FP</code> also removes them from where they were built, so
any subsequent <code>make</code> will have to rebuild them all.

Once you've done an initial build you will
doubtless make further changes, update your trees etc. You'll then
need to do incremental builds, according to what has changed. HabiFoo
and the EC runtime are complicated so there are some things to watch
out for when you make changes. This document lists some of the common
problems you'll encounter. See also the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>,
especially the section on
<a href="FAQ.html#ScratchBuild">building from scratch</a>, which
you need to do before checking in.

<h2><a name="MakeDependencies">Make Dependencies</a></h2>

One big gotcha in our environment is that the makefiles do not track
dependencies. If you change an interface on which other classes
depend, those other classes will NOT get automatically rebuilt. If you
change interfaces it's wise to rebuild from scratch anything that may
depend on those interfaces. Note that building from scratch can be
harder than you'd think; see
<a href="FAQ.html#ScratchBuild">How do I rebuild from scratch?</a>
for details.


<h2><a name="ChangePersistedClass">Changing a Persisted Class</a></h2>

When you quit HabiFoo it creates a checkpoint. If you then make changes
in the source and recompile the checkpoint may no longer be valid. This
happens if you change the layout of some class which has instances saved
in the checkpoint. To get around this (for now) you need to delete all
your old checkpoints and create new avatars. You can do this from a 4dos
(Build) window by:
<blockquote>
  cd \Build\Release
<br>
  deltree /y Avatars Processes <em>OR, on NT</em> rd /qs Avatars Processes
<br>
  md Avatars Processes
<br>
  cd \src\cosm1\start
<br>
  make template
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="RepositoryMediaChanges">Repository Media Changes</a></h2>

When someone adds or changes art in the "\media" directory you'll need
to rebuild your repository to get it. "cd \media" and then type "make"
(to make the new repository), followed by "make install" (to get it
into the \Build\Release area). This is currently a slow process (up to
20 minutes). Felix is working on a way to add a repository to the
build somehow so that not everyone has to build their own.

<h2>Checkin Responsibilities</h2>

1. Before checking in, follow the <a
href="Checkin.html">checkin
guidelines.</a> If you find a bug in the guidelines or you can think
of an improvement, send mail to <a href="mailto:eng_mgmt@communities.com">eng_mgmt.</a>
<p>
(The quick summary: for most major changes, you must update the entire
tree (merging if necessary) and the build from scratch. Building from
scratch is trickier than you'd think; read <a
href="FAQ.html#ScratchBuild">How do I rebuild from scratch?</a> for
details).
<p>

2. Consult with your build buddy before checking in. See <a
href="#buildbuddy">What's a Build Buddy</a> below for an explanation
of what's involved.
<p>

3. When you check in you are responsible for being around to fix any
resulting problems. You are excused once you've proven that your
changes build after being checked in. You can get a buddy to do this, 
or you can use the build machine upstairs. If you leave before you've 
done this and your checkin causes any problems, it will be backed 
out (and you'll be a build breaker - more on that below).
<p>


<h2>What Happens If You Break The Build</h2>

1. You have an hour to fix the problem, either by backing out your
change or adding a fix. For small checkins the answer will nearly
always be to back out. Even if you do fix the problem within an hour,
you still must do Step 2, although you avoid the dreaded Step 3.
<p>

2. As soon as you've fixed the build, write an explanation and mail it
to ec_ibrokethebuild, explaining what happened. If you hit a hidden
gotcha, be sure to explain what it was. If you hit a bug in the build
instructions or checking guidelines be sure to explain that too.
<p>

3. The first time you break the build you get the Tadpole of Shame (TOS). 
Ellen comes by and takes your picture doing whatever you wish 
with the Tadpole, and the picture is put up on The Official EC Build 
Breaker Board. You keep the Tadpole by your desk until the next 
break or a day, whichever comes first. (No bribing others to break 
the build shortly after you.) If the break is especially heinous, you
may graduate straight to the next step. 
<p>

4. If you break the build twice in a month, or you break the build in
an obvious way, or you break the build and aren't around until it's
fixed, you are presented with the Frog of Disgrace (FOD), and again,
Ellen takes your picture and it gets put up on The BBB. Same deal 
with keeping it for a day or until the next break. Finally, the next time 
you check in, you must have as your buddy Trev, Robj, Gordie, or, 
worst case, Paul, the Granddaddy of Un-fun Build Buddies.
<p>


<h2>What's A Build Break</h2>

A build break is when you check in a change that prevents others from
building, running and testing HabiFoo. There's a little mushiness in
this description. We'll be working on a list of "has to work" features
which define whether HabiFoo is testable. But clearly bugs that stop
HabiFoo coming up or stop it connecting to other HabiFoos are build
breaks.
<p>

On rare occasions it may be necessary to check in something that
doesn't run properly, e.g. if person A changes something low level and
then checks it in so person B can make a corresponding high level
change. Such checkins must be okayed by a Big Bad Buddy: Ellen, 
Gordie, RobJ or Trev, and must be accompanied by mail explaining 
what is broken and when it will be fixed.
<p>


<h2><a name="buildbuddy">What's A Build Buddy</a></h2>

A build buddy is someone whom you consult before doing a checkin, and
whose name should be in your checkin message in a "Build Buddy" field. 
You needn't use the same build buddy all the time. The consultation will 
vary according to the size of the checkin.
<p>

For trivial checkins (of the order of changing trace information,
fixing comments etc.) you may not even need a build buddy. Be sure to
mention "no buddy" in your checkin message. (However, if you've just 
broken the build, even trivial checkins require a buddy.)
<p>

For simple changes a quick consultation, where you describe what you've
changed and show your buddy the list of changes, is all that's needed.
<p>

For complex changes you should get your buddy to copy the files you've
changed and test them out.
<p>

For world shaking changes you can give your buddy the changes, you both
build full releases and test the result, possibly with Paul's help.

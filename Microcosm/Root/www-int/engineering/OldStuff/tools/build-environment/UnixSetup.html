<h2>Assumed Knowledge</h2>

<ul>
<li>A familiarity with UNIX, including some exposure to shell programming
<LI>Know how to use at least one UNIX editor </LI>
<LI>Basic knowledge of the MAKE utility</LI></UL>
</ul>

<h2>Before You Start</h2>

<ul>

<li>Speak with Rob Kinninmont, our most benevolent and beloved systems administrator, about getting a UNIX login.

<li>Request that Rob set up <code>tcsh</code> as your default shell.

<li>To get access to Unix from your Windows box, install CRT (our
standard Windows terminal program) by running
<A HREF="file:///\\alexandria/public/windows/Telnet_CRT20.exe">\\alexandria\public\windows\Telnet_CRT20.exe</A>
<p>
Here is the registration information for CRT, which you can cut and paste from this document.
<blockquote>
  Name: 25 User Right To Use License
<br>
  Company: Electric Communities
<br>
  Serial Number: 01-11-100115
<br>
  Expiration: Never
<br>
  xKey: p29m vb29 uai0 vn73 8crv uvj2 ehuu 74hm
</blockquote>

<li>Read the <a HREF="../CVSMakeBash/cvsdoc/cvs-primer.html">CVS Primer</a>

<li>For reference you can see the
<A HREF="../../../userdoc/third_party/cvs_1_9_14/cvs_toc.html">CVS Manual</A>

</ul>

<h2>Setting Up A Solaris Development Environment</h2>
This is very similar to setting up a windows development environment.

<ul>

<li>Log into your favorite Solaris machine (e.g., harpo) and edit the
<code>.cshrc </code> file in your home directory. Add the following
line to the end of this file.
<br>
<code>source /home/eng/unix/ECEnvironment</code>

<LI>At the command line prompt, type the following commands:
<blockquote>
  cd
<br>
  source ~/.cshrc
</blockquote>

<LI>Check out a copy of the current source tree by entering the following commands in your unix shell:
<blockquote>
cd
<br>
mkdir cvs
<br>
cd cvs
<br>
cvs co src media
</blockquote>
Note that "media" is optional. You needn't check it out unless you want to
build repositories.

</ul>

<h2>Building and Running HabiFoo on Solaris</h2>

<b>Warning; this probably still needs updating - I'm not sure how to run
HabiFoo on Solaris any more</b>
<p>
At a UNIX command prompt, type the following commands:
<blockquote>
cd $COSM
<br>
gnumake
</blockquote>
This will build the HabiFoo application, which takes about fifteen minutes.
When this process is complete, type
<blockquote>
cd $COSM/start
<br>
gnumake
<br>
cd $BUILD/Release
<br>
./console OneRegion
</blockquote>
This will start Microcosm in console mode. It's really much more interesting on Windows.

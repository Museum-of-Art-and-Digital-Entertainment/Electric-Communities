Thanks to Mike for making this available and writing it up.

Here are the steps to create and run with a "startup.zip" file and
background class loading. This process is a little tedious - because
Habi* must be run twice by hand to generate a list of startup classes
- but manageable.
<p>
Note: One thing you will have to do for the next couple of days that
is not in the steps below (because it will be done automatically) is
copy \src\cosm1\start\bin\makeStartupList.sh to \ec\fp\cosm\win32\bin.
<p>

I expect that some part of this process will be done for everyone as part of the release process.  
<p>

<b>Step 1: Making a list of startup classes</b><p>

Normal build steps:
<ul>
<li> open up build shell
<li> cd /src
<li> make everything
<li> make release
<li> put a repository in /build/release/echome/dist
</ul>
<p>
	
The tricky part:
<ul>
<li> cd /build/release
<li> run rlm = what ever you want
<li> quit w/ checkpoint (Don't ^C)
<li> run verbose = true >&> classlist.tmp
<li> ^C out after startup is done
</ul>
<p>
Finally:
<ul>
<li>bash makeStartupList.sh classlist.tmp <listOfClassesToExcludeIfAny>
</ul>
<p>

The above process will generate the files startupPreloadClasses.txt, which is put in /build/release and /src/cosm1/start, and startupZipClasses.txt, which is put into /src/cosm1/start. The intermediate file "classlist.tmp" is not deleted because it's a pain to recreate if something goes wrong.
<p>

<b>Step 2: Creating a startup.zip file</b><p>

<ul>
<li> cd /src/cosm1/start
<li> make sure that the file startupZipClasses.txt is in the directory
<li> make startupzip
</ul>
<p>
The result of this will be the file "startup.zip" which is put into /Build/Release
<p>
<b> Step 3: Running</b><p>

<ul>
<li> cd /build/release
<p>
</ul>
<ul>
Normal Running
<ul>
<li> run 
</ul>
<p>
Background thread class loading
<ul>
<li> run preload = background
</ul>
<p>
To run with classes preloaded - a useful thing to do when one wishes to test startup performance changes sans classload.
<ul>
<li> run preload = preload
</ul>
</ul>

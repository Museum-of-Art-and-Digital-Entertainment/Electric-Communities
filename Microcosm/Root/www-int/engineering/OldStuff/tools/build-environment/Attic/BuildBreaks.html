<h2>Current And Very Recent Build Breaks</h2>

<ul>

<li>12/17/97 Latest build often fails when trying to connect to PLS
or another HabiFoo. It's probably a problem with regular expressions
(they changed last night, and they are used to parse EARLs, which
are used when you try to connect to another HabiFoo).

<li>12/16/97 Release r115 tends to deadlock at startup; developers may
see this too, especially if using AccountManager (try run.bat if you
do hit this problem). Paul is patching Gordie's deadlock workaround
into the release to see if it helps.

<li>12/16/97 New spam at startup; lots of error messages about
widgets being unable to find images.

</ul>

<h2>Recent Build Breaks (All Fixed)</h2>

<ul>

<li>12/16/97 (Fixed by Mike, 12/16) Todays repository doesn't seem to
have certificates so TOS will be broken. Attempting to build your own
repository doesn't help, seems like the repository build process is
not reaching the certification server. Mike is working to fix this.

<li>12/10/97 The following was fixed by Eric, who got the full-release
target working again (making some of the description below irrelevant)
When building a full release (as described in <A
href="BuildRelease.html">Building a release</a>) two of the later
targets don't work properly. hub-release fails trying to copy First
Part (FP) DLLs into the release area. Felix is looking at this. And
build-zipfiles appears to succeed but produces zipfiles containing the
wrong pathnames. Mike and Felix are looking at this.

<li>12/15/97 Bill found that ".\regupdate -dev -debug" in
"\Build\Release\bin" didn't work properly, after starting up a 4dos
(Build) shell and doing "make nobuild release getrep". Fix was to use
Felix's new "-savepaths" argument e.g. ".\regupdate -debug
-savepaths". "-dev" doesn't seem to work properly (and should be
removed?).

<li>12/15/97 Bill got a weird repository error when he did a "make
nobuild release getrep" in \src. Since then no-one has been able to
reproduce it.

<li>12/15/97 run.bat has preloading turned on by default, resulting in
a class not found error at run time. As of around 11:00am, 12/15, Mike
has checked in a fix, and as of 12:30 Felix checked his fix into \EC.
Check out in \EC to get the fixed run.bat.

<li>12/15/97 When building in \media you may get an error of the form:
"/ec/gnu/bin/find: lib: No such file or directory". You can workaround
it by creating the \media\lib directory manually. As of 12:30pm on
12/15 Felix has checked in a fix, which you can get by doing "cvs
update create.bom" in \media.

<li>12/12/97 A new E runtime fix was checked in with a file missing
(EChannel.java) causing the build to break. The file was checked in on
12/13, fixing the problem.

<li>12/12/97 RtCodeableThrowable was moved to a different package, but
the src\cosm1 tree wasn't updated. Fixed later on 12/12.

<li>12/10/97 All the makefile targets changed, and the docs didn't
until later in the day. Latest docs now have the new targets.

</ul>

-Warren Teitelman, ICSE, 1983 or 1984</P><DIR>

</CITE><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>If you spend time analyzing bugs, you'll find that a certain significant percentage of them are repeats: bugs that have been made before. A couple of classic examples:</P></DIR>


<UL>
<LI>Off-by-one errors. </LI>
<LI>Forgetting to check for error returns from write(). (Sometimes that's not worth doing, but it should be a conscious decision, not an oversight. I once heard of a backup product that failed to check whether a write failed because the tape filled up. Guess how the bug was discovered?)</LI></UL>
<DIR>

<P>These particular catalogs are for programmers or for testers poking around in the code. In keeping with the quote above, their purpose is less to teach than to jog you into remembering something you know, but happened to overlook. To use them:</P></DIR>

<OL>

<LI>Pick a catalog. For example, if you're writing E code, you'll use the E catalog. If your code uses a particular ingredient, you'll use that ingredient's catalog.</LI>
<LI>Scan through the entries, deciding which might apply to your code. For example, if you use E exceptions, you'd use the "E exceptions" entry.</LI>
<LI>Each entry contains a series of hints. For example, the "E exceptions" entry contains:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ethrow is a message send.<BR>
Ecatch creates a closure.<BR>
</B>…<BR>
<BR>
You can use those hints as a checklist. Use them before or after you write the code, as you prefer. A hint might also suggest a test case. (Sometimes it's easier or more reliable to check that the code works by reading it, sometimes by executing it.) The first time you read a hint, it might not mean much, but there's explanatory text below each one. There may also be a hyperlink to an example.</LI></OL>

<UL>
<LI>Eventually there'll be a table-of-contents frame on the left side.</LI>
<LI>If a cheat sheet with nothing more than the one-line summaries is useful, I'll produce one.</LI></UL>

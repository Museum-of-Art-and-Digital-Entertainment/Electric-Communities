/**
 * The Key interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
 * defines the functionality shared by all key objects. All keys
 * have three characteristics:
 * 
 * <UL>
 * 
 * <LI>An Algorithm
 * 
 * <P>This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually
 * an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or
 * RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related
 * algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.)
 * The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the 
 * <a href = "#getAlgorithm">getAlgorithm</a> method.<P>
 * 
 * <LI>An Encoded Form
 * 
 * <P>This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
 * representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
 * as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
 * is encoded according to a standard format (such as X.509
 * or PKCS#8), and is returned using the 
 * <a href = "#getEncoded">getEncoded</a> method.<P>
 * 
 * <LI>A Format
 * 
 * <P>This is the name of the format of the encoded key. It is returned 
 * by the <a href = "#getFormat">getFormat</a> method.<P>
 * 
 * </UL>
 * 
 * Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
 * or various Identity classes used to manage keys. There are no
 * provisions in this release for the parsing of encoded keys and
 * certificates.

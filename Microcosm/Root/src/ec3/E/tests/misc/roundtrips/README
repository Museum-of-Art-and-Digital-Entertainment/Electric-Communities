Compile with: ecomp *.e

Run like so:
1) go EServer
2) Wait 'til it says 'server running' - this means it has exported its
   SturdyRef as EServer.ref
3) go EClient

EClient will connect and start sending randomly sized messages to the
EServer, which will simply bounce them back. Tweak Message.e as you see
fit.

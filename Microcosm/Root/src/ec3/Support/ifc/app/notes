This is a place to put notes about known problems and issues with the ui classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECScrollBorder is implemented in a way that makes it only look right when it's
bordering a view with a vertical scroll bar but no horizontal scroll bar. It
could be renamed or generalized; comments in ECScrollBorder.java explain the
problem in more detail.

When a tip is displayed, it's redrawing the entire rootView instead of just
the bounding rectangle of the tip itself. This is inefficient, which might
not matter but probably would if the tips changed often.

ECTabView became a huge class.  We need to create a ECScrollableTabView subclass.  
It will save a lot of memory when we want to create non-scrollable tab view.

This directory contains a collection of "examples" for the Pluribus compiler. They may not be complete or functional; _running the resulting Unum code_ in particular seems to rely on Java services and URLs to servers that have not yet been restored. Watch this space.

Note: To find the makefiles for some of the examples, I had to go to ec2. 
And those ec2 directories had more files, such as .bat files to run tests on the objects.
Also, many of these objects are throwing unum-errors suggesting that the unum/presence model evolveled between ec2 and ec3. Check out out the CoinToss directory.

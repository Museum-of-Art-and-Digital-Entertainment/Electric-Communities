This is a simple example unum which demonstrates 

o the most basic kind of unum start-up, and 
o the sending of a single message to the unum
o unum registration and multiple presences.

It doesn't change (or even initialize) shared state.

It doesn't demonstrate a client-server presence model.

It doesn't demonstrate how to use a user interface peer / factory.

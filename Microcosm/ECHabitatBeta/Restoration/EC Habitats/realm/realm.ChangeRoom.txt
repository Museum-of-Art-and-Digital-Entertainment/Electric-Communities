For more detailed information, press Control-H for Help, and then open the Quick Start.;1. Get a new avatar body. To do this, use the Avatar catalog. Click the Catalog button on the main window to bring up catalogs. Open the Avatars catalog, select the desired body type, and click Swap.;2. Change avatar appearance. Using the Swatch catalog, you can change the color and texture of your body and clothing. Create the swatch and hold it. Then, from your avatar menu, select an item from the ''Apply Swatch to'' submenu.;3. Create a personal profile in your Address Book for others to see. To open your Address Book to your personal page, select ''Modify my info'' from your avatar menu.;4. Enter EC Neighborhoods. You can explore different regions, meet and talk to other people, and collect objects. Click the globe to register now!;5.  Add others to your Address Book. This lets you set privileges for them, contact them through Audio and Telepathy, and visit their turf. From the avatar’s menu, select ''Add to Address book'' to open your Address Book to their page.;6. Create a personal home region (called a turf). You can host other users in your turf without having to connect to the EC Neighborhoods. Open the Turf catalog (see 1) and create the one you want.;7. Personalize your turf. Using the catalogs, create new decorations and furniture.;8. Visit somebody else’s turf. To visit somebody, bring up his/her page in your Address Book (see 5), and click the Turfs button at the bottom of the window.;9. Link your turf to others. Each user can get a portal object to their turf by selecting ''Get portal to here'' from the turf watermark (upper left corner of region). Give these portals to others to put in their own turf. Then, people can simply click the portal for the turf they want to visit.;10. Create additional avatar identities using the Account Manager. To access the Account Manager, select EC Habitats:Account Manager from the Windows Start:Programs menu."

For now, try sending telepathy to yourself.;7. Your avatar can gesture and change facial expressions. Try clicking on some of the Body and Face buttons at the bottom of the window.;8. To move to the next region, you can click on doors and other ''gateways'' in the region. Or you can teleport someplace further away by selecting ''Teleport to'' from your avatar's menu.;9. That's enough to get you started. For help at any time, click the Help button at the top right of this window. Or you can click again to review these instructions.

# echabitats-installer

This is an installer for EC Habitats created using [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) v6.2.1.

To compile the installer executable, just open the ECHabitatsInstaller.iss script file in Inno Setup and click Build > Compile. 

The files used to create this installer were taken directly from the original EC Habitats beta r167 CD, a copy of which can be found on the [RenoProject website](https://renoproject.org/pub/ECHabitats/Clients/).

If you have any additions or tweaks, please submit a pull request.

# EC Habitats beta r167 client


The Microcosm platform was released in Beta under the name ECHabitats. Build r167 was burned on to CD-roms and distributed to a limited number of testers.

The Archive directory holds the original installation files from that installer.

The Restoration directory contains a repackaged version of that installer for modern operating systems.

Either installer should work and both have been tested in Windows 11. However, if you experience issues with the modern installer, please use the original version instead.
